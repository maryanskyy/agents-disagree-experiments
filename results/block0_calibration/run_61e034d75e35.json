Internal validity threats (causality)\n1) **No control group (history / maturation / time effects)**\n   - Scores can increase over time for many reasons unrelated to the tutor: regular classroom instruction, homework, additional studying, tutoring elsewhere, increased familiarity with the content, or natural learning progression.\n\n2) **Regression to the mean**\n   - If volunteers were motivated because they were doing poorly (or had an unusually low prior score), their scores could rise toward their typical level even without any intervention.\n\n3) **Testing/practice effects**\n   - A pre-test can itself improve post-test performance (students learn what is emphasized, change study habits, or benefit from repeated exposure to exam format).\n\n4) **Instrumentation / non-equated exams**\n   - The \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d exams were **not equated for difficulty**. If the second exam was easier (or aligned more closely with what students studied), the score gain may be an artifact.\n\n5) **Hawthorne / novelty effects and demand characteristics**\n   - Knowing they are in a study and using a new tool may increase effort and engagement temporarily, inflating short-term gains.\n\n6) **Co-interventions and contamination**\n   - Students may simultaneously use other resources (friends, online videos, private tutors). Without tracking and balancing these, the gain cannot be attributed to the AI tutor.\n\n7) **Attrition (not reported)**\n   - If some students dropped out and only completers were analyzed, results can be biased upward (especially if struggling students are more likely to stop).\n\n### B. External validity threats (generalizability)\n1) **Self-selection of volunteers**\n   - Volunteers are usually more motivated, more tech-comfortable, and more engaged than typical students. Results won\u2019t generalize to all students.\n\n2) **Small, likely unrepresentative sample**\n   - N=40 may be from one school/class/context. Broad \u201ceffectiveness\u201d claims require broader sampling.\n\n3) **Short duration**\n   - Two weeks does not establish sustained learning gains; improvements may be temporary.\n\n---\n\n## Why \u201cp < 0.05\u201d from a paired t-test is insufficient\n\n1) **Statistical significance is not causation**\n   - A paired t-test only assesses whether the **mean change** differs from zero in this group. It does **not** rule out alternative explanations (history, maturation, easier test, practice effects, etc.).\n\n2) **With no control group, the null hypothesis is the wrong comparison**\n   - The relevant question is not \u201cdid scores change?\u201d but \u201cdid scores change **more than they would have without the tutor**?\u201d That counterfactual is unobserved here.\n\n3) **P-values ignore key design flaws**\n   - Non-equivalent exams, self-selection, and uncontrolled co-interventions can produce \u201csignificant\u201d changes even when the tutor has no true effect.\n\n4) **Effect size is not established as attributable**\n   - The increase from 64 to 80 is large descriptively, but without an appropriate comparator, it cannot be interpreted as the tutor\u2019s causal effect.\n\n---\n\n## A minimally credible redesign (feasible within one school term)\n\nBelow is a design that is both practical and meaningfully strengthens causal inference.\n\n### 1) Sampling and recruitment\n- **Population:** Students enrolled in a specific course (e.g., Algebra I) across multiple classes in the same school (or multiple schools if possible).\n- **Recruitment:** Invite *all* students in participating classes; obtain consent.\n- **Baseline data:** Collect prior grades, baseline test scores, attendance, demographic variables, and device access to check balance and support subgroup analyses.\n\n### 2) Randomization (preferred)\n**Option A: Individual-level RCT (best if contamination is manageable)**\n- Randomly assign students to:\n  - **Treatment:** AI tutor access + standard instruction\n  - **Control:** standard instruction + an \u201cactive control\u201d resource (e.g., existing practice worksheets or a non-adaptive digital practice tool) with similar time expectations  \n- Require/encourage comparable time-on-task across groups; track usage logs.\n\n**Option B: Cluster RCT (often more realistic in schools)**\n- Randomize at the **classroom/teacher** level to avoid spillovers (students sharing answers or the tool).\n- Stratify randomization by teacher, class period, or baseline performance to improve balance.\n\n### 3) Quasi-experimental fallback (if randomization is blocked)\nIf the school refuses random assignment:\n- **Matched comparison with difference-in-differences**\n  - Identify comparable classes/schools not using the tutor.\n  - Match on prior achievement, teacher experience, curriculum pacing, and demographics.\n  - Use pre-term to post-term changes and compare trends.\n- **Stepped-wedge rollout** (often acceptable politically)\n  - All classes eventually receive the tutor, but rollout timing is randomized (or at least scheduled exogenously).\n  - Early vs. late adopters provide the comparison window.\n\nRandomization (even at cluster level) is still strongly preferred.\n\n### 4) Outcome measurement (make the test evidence credible)\n- **Primary outcome:** Performance on a **common, equated assessment**\n  - Ideally a standardized benchmark test, or\n  - A researcher/department-created exam with:\n    - Pre/post forms **equated** (e.g., via item response theory or at minimum anchor items and pilot calibration)\n    - Same blueprint, difficulty distribution, and timing\n- **Secondary outcomes (pre-specified):**\n  - Course exam grades (if common across classes)\n  - Retention test 4\u20136 weeks later (to assess durable learning)\n  - Engagement/time-on-task, but treat as mediators not primary outcomes\n- **Blinding:**\n  - Use objective scoring (multiple-choice or externally graded constructed response).\n  - Keep graders blind to condition if open-ended items exist.\n\n### 5) Implementation fidelity and exposure\n- Track:\n  - Minutes practiced, number of problems, mastery metrics\n  - Compliance (who actually used it)\n  - Co-interventions (self-reported other tutoring/resources)\n- Predefine:\n  - Minimum intended dosage (e.g., 90 minutes/week)\n  - Handling of noncompliance (intention-to-treat as primary;

If one has D, the other does not.\n- We don't yet know if Atlas or Drift has D, but they can't both have it.\n\n**Step 3: Explore whether Beacon has anomalous login location (Fact 3).**\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L **if and only if** Cipher does NOT have P.\n- This creates two branches:\n\n### Branch A: Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L\n\n**Step 4: Determine who else has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems have P).**\n- Cipher has P (Branch A assumption). We need exactly one more system with P.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P **only if** Beacon has L. In Branch A, Beacon does NOT have L, so Atlas does NOT have P.\n- Therefore the second system with P must be either Beacon or Drift.\n\n**Step 4a: Sub-branch \u2014 Beacon has P.**\n- Beacon has P but NOT L (from Branch A). So Beacon cannot be the critical incident (needs all three).\n- Cipher has P and D. Does Cipher have L? If Cipher has L, P, and D, Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Fact 1 says exactly one system has all three. Let's check consistency.\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L.\n- Atlas: no P. Drift: no P (only Cipher and Beacon have P in this sub-branch). So neither Atlas nor Drift can be the critical incident (Fact 4 requires P).\n- Beacon: has P but not L \u2192 not the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident must be Cipher, which requires Cipher to have L.\n- **Check: Does Cipher having L, P, D violate anything?** No fact prohibits Cipher from having L.\n- **Check Fact 1:** Exactly one system has all three. We need to verify no other system has all three. Atlas lacks P, Beacon lacks L, Drift lacks L (Fact 6) and lacks P \u2192 confirmed, only Cipher has all three. \u2713\n- **This sub-branch is consistent.** Cipher is the critical incident.\n\n**Step 4b: Sub-branch \u2014 Drift has P (instead of Beacon).**\n- Drift has P but NOT L (Fact 6). So Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- Cipher has P and D. For Cipher to be the critical incident, Cipher needs L.\n- If Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Check: Does any other system have all three? Atlas has no P. Beacon has no L and no P. Drift has no L. \u2192 Only Cipher could. \u2713\n- But wait \u2014 we need to verify Fact 1: exactly one system has all three. This also works.\n- **However**, let me check whether this sub-branch creates any contradiction with Fact 2.\n- Cipher has D (Fact 5). Does Drift have D? Drift is in the same zone as Atlas (Fact 2), not Cipher. Fact 2 only constrains Atlas and Drift. No contradiction yet.\n- Does Atlas have D? If Atlas has D, then Drift does not (Fact 2), and vice versa. This is unconstrained further, so multiple possibilities exist.\n- **This sub-branch is also consistent with Cipher as the critical incident.**\n\nSo in Branch A, **Cipher is the critical incident** regardless of which sub-branch.\n\n### Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P \u2192 Beacon HAS L\n\n**Step 5: Determine who has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems).**\n- Cipher does NOT have P. So the two systems with P are among {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. In Branch B, Beacon HAS L, so Atlas MAY have P (not forced, but permitted).\n- Fact 4: The critical incident must have P. Since Cipher lacks P, Cipher cannot be the critical incident.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the critical incident candidate in Branch B.**\n- The critical incident needs L, P, and D (Fact 1).\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L \u2192 Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident is either Atlas or Beacon.\n\n**Step 6a: Could Atlas be the critical incident?**\n- Atlas needs L, P, and D.\n- If Atlas has D, then Drift does NOT have D (Fact 2). \u2713 possible.\n- Atlas needs P: permitted since Beacon has L (Fact 7). \u2713\n- Atlas needs L: no fact prohibits this. \u2713\n- Exactly two systems have P. Atlas has P; who is the second? Must be Beacon or Drift.\n- Check: Does any other system also have all three? We need to ensure exactly one does (Fact 1).\n  - Beacon has L. If Beacon also has P and D, Beacon would also have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1.\n  - So if Atlas is the critical incident, Beacon must lack P or lack D (or both).\n  - If Beacon lacks P: then the second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - If Beacon has P but lacks D: Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713\n- Both seem possible on the surface. But let's check further.\n- **This sub-branch doesn't immediately contradict**, but let's see if Branch B itself leads to a unique answer.\n\n**Step 6b: Could Beacon be the critical incident?**\n- Beacon needs L (has it \u2713), P, and D.\n- Exactly two systems have P. Beacon has P; who is the second? Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 says Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713, so permitted.\n  - If Drift has P: also permitted.\n- Beacon needs D: no fact prohibits this.\n- Check Fact 1: no other system should have all three.\n  - Atlas: if Atlas has L, P, and D \u2192 violation. So we must ensure Atlas doesn't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n  - Cipher: no P \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n\n**Step 7: Branch B gives multiple candidates (Atlas or Beacon), so we need additional constraints to resolve or reject Branch B.**\n\n- Fact 1: **Exactly one** system has all three indicators. This is a uniqueness constraint but doesn't by itself eliminate Branch B.\n- However, the puzzle states \"exactly one alert is a true critical incident\" and the facts should yield a **unique** answer. Let me re-examine whether Branch B is actually consistent.\n\n**Critical check on Branch B:**\n- In Branch B, Cipher does NOT have P. Cipher has D (Fact 5). The critical incident is not Cipher.\n- We need exactly two systems with P from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Let me try Atlas as critical incident: Atlas has L, P, D.\n  - Fact 2: Atlas has D \u2192 Drift does NOT have D. \u2713\n  - Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift.\n  - Fact 1: Only Atlas has all three. So Beacon must lack at least one of {P, D} (Beacon already has L).\n    - If Beacon has P: Beacon must lack D. Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713 (Fact 8)\n    - If Beacon lacks P: Second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - Both work. But does any other fact constrain further? Let me check all facts:\n    - Fact 6: Drift no L \u2713\n    - Fact 3: Beacon has L iff Cipher lacks P \u2192 Cipher lacks P \u2713, Beacon has L \u2713\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713\n    - All facts satisfied.\n\n- Let me try Beacon as critical incident: Beacon has L, P, D.\n  - Second P-holder: Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 requires Beacon has L \u2713.\n    - Does Atlas have all three? Atlas needs L and D too. If Atlas lacks L or D, fine.\n    - Fact 2: If Atlas has D, Drift doesn't. If Atlas doesn't have D, no constraint triggered.\n    - This is consistent.\n  - If Drift has P: Two P-holders: Beacon, Drift.\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. Atlas doesn't have P. \u2713 (vacuously true)\n    - Consistent.\n\n**Branch B appears to allow multiple solutions, which means the puzzle would be ambiguous if Branch B were valid. Since the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, let me re-examine whether Branch B truly holds up.**\n\n**Wait \u2014 let me reconsider Fact 1 more carefully.** Fact 1 says: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" This is a given fact, not a definition of the critical incident. Fact 4 says: \"Any system in the critical incident state must have privileged token use.\" The critical incident is the system with all three indicators (from Fact 1, since it's the one that \"must be escalated\").\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem. \"Exactly one alert is a true critical incident that must be escalated.\" And Fact 1: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" The critical incident IS the system with all three indicators. Fact 4 adds that the critical incident must have P (which is already entailed by having all three, so Fact 4 is either redundant or serves to eliminate systems without P from consideration).\n\nSo the question is: do the facts uniquely determine which system has all three?\n\n**Let me reconsider whether Branch B is actually valid by checking if it leads to a contradiction I missed.**\n\nIn Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P.\n- Fact 8: Exactly two systems have P, from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. (Beacon has L in Branch B, so this is non-restrictive.)\n- Fact 6: Drift has no L.\n\nLet me enumerate the possible pairs with P:\n1. {Atlas, Beacon}\n2. {Atlas, Drift}\n3. {Beacon, Drift}\n\nFor each, who could have all three (L, P, D)?\n\n**Case B1: {Atlas, Beacon} have P.**\n- Atlas: has P. Has L? Unknown. Has D? If yes, Drift has no D (Fact 2).\n- Beacon: has P, has L. Has D? Unknown.\n- For exactly one to have all three:\n  - If Atlas has all three: Atlas has L, P, D. Then Beacon must lack D (to not have all three, since Beacon has L and P). Possible.\n  - If Beacon has all three: Beacon has L, P, D. Then Atlas must lack L or D. Possible.\n  - Could both have all three? Only if both have L, P, D. Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). Beacon has D. Cipher has D. So D-holders: Atlas, Beacon, Cipher. That's fine, no rule against it. Atlas has L, Beacon has L. No rule against both having L. So both could have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1. So we need exactly one.\n  - This means: either Atlas has all three and Beacon doesn't, or Beacon has all three and Atlas doesn't. Two sub-cases, both consistent. **Ambiguous.**\n\n**Case B2: {Atlas, Drift} have P.**\n- Beacon has L but no P \u2192 Beacon can't have all three.\n- Atlas: has P. Needs L and D for all three.\n- Drift: has P, no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n- So only Atlas can be the critical incident. Atlas needs L and D.\n  - Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). \u2713\n  - Atlas has L: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Atlas. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Atlas would be the critical incident.**\n\n**Case B3: {Beacon, Drift} have P.**\n- Atlas has no P \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Drift has P, no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Beacon has P, L. Needs D for all three.\n  - Beacon has D: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Beacon. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Beacon would be the critical incident.**\n\nSo Branch B gives three possible answers (Atlas in B1 or B2, Beacon in B1 or B3). This means Branch B must be **invalid** for the puzzle to have a unique solution.\n\n**Therefore Branch A must be the correct branch, and Cipher is the critical incident.**\n\nLet me verify: **Branch B is invalid** means Cipher DOES have P (negating the Branch B assumption that Cipher does not have P).\n\n**Final verification of Branch A (Cipher has P):**\n- Cipher has P and D (Facts 4, 5).\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L \u2194 Cipher lacks P. Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. Beacon does NOT have L \u2192 Atlas does NOT have P (contrapositive).\n- Fact 8: Exactly two have P. Cipher has P, Atlas doesn't. So the second is Beacon or Drift.\n- Fact 1: Exactly one system has all three. The critical incident must have P (Fact 4).\n  - Atlas: no P \u2192 not critical.\n  - Beacon: no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - **Cipher: has P, has D, needs L.** Cipher must have L for exactly one system to have all three.\n- Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 **Cipher is the critical incident.** \u2713\n- No other system has all three: Atlas (no P), Beacon (no L), Drift (no L). \u2713\n- Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift (either works; the puzzle doesn't require us to determine this, and both are consistent). \u2713\n\n**All facts verified. Cipher is uniquely the critical incident.**\n\n---\n\n# Section 3: Reusable Reasoning Procedure for Signal-Dependent Triage Puzzles\n\n1. **Catalog indicators and constraints.** List all binary signals (present/absent) for each entity. Identify biconditionals, conditionals, exclusivity constraints, and cardinality constraints.\n\n2. **Apply unconditional facts first.** Lock in any signals that are stated as definite (e.g., \"Cipher has D,\" \"Drift does not have L\"). These reduce the search space immediately.\n\n3. **Identify pivot constraints \u2014 biconditionals and cardinality limits.** These create hard branching points. A biconditional (Fact 3) forces a binary split. A cardinality constraint (Fact 8: exactly two with P) limits combinations.\n\n4. **Branch on the pivot and propagate.** For each branch, apply conditionals (especially contrapositives) to derive forced values. Chain implications: if A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C, propagate fully before checking consistency.\n\n5. **Apply the uniqueness test.** If the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, any branch that permits multiple valid solutions is **invalid** (because the puzzle would be ambiguous). This is a powerful meta-constraint: the correct branch must yield exactly one answer.\n\n6. **Verify the surviving branch exhaustively.** Check every stated fact against the derived assignment. Confirm that the \"exactly one\" and cardinality constraints hold.\n\n7. **Document the elimination chain.** For each rejected alternative, state the specific fact or combination of facts that eliminates it. This creates an auditable trail.\n\n**Key heuristic:** When constraints are partially dependent (signals on one entity affect what's possible on another), always propagate contrapositives immediately \u2014 they often eliminate more possibilities than the original conditional.\n\n---\n\n# Section 4: Real-",

Fact 4 adds that the critical incident must have P (which is already entailed by having all three, so Fact 4 is either redundant or serves to eliminate systems without P from consideration).\n\nSo the question is: do the facts uniquely determine which system has all three?\n\n**Let me reconsider whether Branch B is actually valid by checking if it leads to a contradiction I missed.**\n\nIn Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P.\n- Fact 8: Exactly two systems have P, from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. (Beacon has L in Branch B, so this is non-restrictive.)\n- Fact 6: Drift has no L.\n\nLet me enumerate the possible pairs with P:\n1. {Atlas, Beacon}\n2. {Atlas, Drift}\n3. {Beacon, Drift}\n\nFor each, who could have all three (L, P, D)?\n\n**Case B1: {Atlas, Beacon} have P.**\n- Atlas: has P. Has L? Unknown. Has D? If yes, Drift has no D (Fact 2).\n- Beacon: has P, has L. Has D? Unknown.\n- For exactly one to have all three:\n  - If Atlas has all three: Atlas has L, P, D. Then Beacon must lack D (to not have all three, since Beacon has L and P). Possible.\n  - If Beacon has all three: Beacon has L, P, D. Then Atlas must lack L or D. Possible.\n  - Could both have all three? Only if both have L, P, D. Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). Beacon has D. Cipher has D. So D-holders: Atlas, Beacon, Cipher. That's fine, no rule against it. Atlas has L, Beacon has L. No rule against both having L. So both could have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1. So we need exactly one.\n  - This means: either Atlas has all three and Beacon doesn't, or Beacon has all three and Atlas doesn't. Two sub-cases, both consistent. **Ambiguous.**\n\n**Case B2: {Atlas, Drift} have P.**\n- Beacon has L but no P \u2192 Beacon can't have all three.\n- Atlas: has P. Needs L and D for all three.\n- Drift: has P, no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n- So only Atlas can be the critical incident. Atlas needs L and D.\n  - Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). \u2713\n  - Atlas has L: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Atlas. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Atlas would be the critical incident.**\n\n**Case B3: {Beacon, Drift} have P.**\n- Atlas has no P \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Drift has P, no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Beacon has P, L. Needs D for all three.\n  - Beacon has D: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Beacon. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Beacon would be the critical incident.**\n\nSo Branch B gives three possible answers (Atlas in B1 or B2, Beacon in B1 or B3). This means Branch B must be **invalid** for the puzzle to have a unique solution.\n\n**Therefore Branch A must be the correct branch, and Cipher is the critical incident.**\n\nLet me verify: **Branch B is invalid** means Cipher DOES have P (negating the Branch B assumption that Cipher does not have P).\n\n**Final verification of Branch A (Cipher has P):**\n- Cipher has P and D (Facts 4, 5).\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L \u2194 Cipher lacks P. Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. Beacon does NOT have L \u2192 Atlas does NOT have P (contrapositive).\n- Fact 8: Exactly two have P. Cipher has P, Atlas doesn't. So the second is Beacon or Drift.\n- Fact 1: Exactly one system has all three. The critical incident must have P (Fact 4).\n  - Atlas: no P \u2192 not critical.\n  - Beacon: no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - **Cipher: has P, has D, needs L.** Cipher must have L for exactly one system to have all three.\n- Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 **Cipher is the critical incident.** \u2713\n- No other system has all three: Atlas (no P), Beacon (no L), Drift (no L). \u2713\n- Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift (either works; the puzzle doesn't require us to determine this, and both are consistent). \u2713\n\n**All facts verified. Cipher is uniquely the critical incident.**\n\n---\n\n# Section 3: Reusable Reasoning Procedure for Signal-Dependent Triage Puzzles\n\n1. **Catalog indicators and constraints.** List all binary signals (present/absent) for each entity. Identify biconditionals, conditionals, exclusivity constraints, and cardinality constraints.\n\n2. **Apply unconditional facts first.** Lock in any signals that are stated as definite (e.g., \"Cipher has D,\" \"Drift does not have L\"). These reduce the search space immediately.\n\n3. **Identify pivot constraints \u2014 biconditionals and cardinality limits.** These create hard branching points. A biconditional (Fact 3) forces a binary split. A cardinality constraint (Fact 8: exactly two with P) limits combinations.\n\n4. **Branch on the pivot and propagate.** For each branch, apply conditionals (especially contrapositives) to derive forced values. Chain implications: if A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C, propagate fully before checking consistency.\n\n5. **Apply the uniqueness test.** If the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, any branch that permits multiple valid solutions is **invalid** (because the puzzle would be ambiguous). This is a powerful meta-constraint: the correct branch must yield exactly one answer.\n\n6. **Verify the surviving branch exhaustively.** Check every stated fact against the derived assignment. Confirm that the \"exactly one\" and cardinality constraints hold.\n\n7. **Document the elimination chain.** For each rejected alternative, state the specific fact or combination of facts that eliminates it. This creates an auditable trail.\n\n**Key heuristic:** When constraints are partially dependent (signals on one entity affect what's possible on another), always propagate contrapositives immediately \u2014 they often eliminate more possibilities than the original conditional.\n\n---\n\n# Section 4: Real-",

        "# section 1: answer **cipher is the true critical incident.** --- # section 2: step-by-step deduction chain let me denote the three indicators as: - **l** = anomalous login location - **p** = privileged token use - **d** = abnormal data transfer volume a system is the critical incident if and only if it has all three: l, p, and d (fact 1), and it must have p (fact 4, which is consistent). **step 1: establish cipher's data transfer volume.** - fact 5: cipher has d. \u2713 **step 2: apply the network zone constraint (fact 2).** - atlas and drift are in the same zone. if one has d, the other does not. - we don't yet know if atlas or drift has d, but they can't both have it. **step 3: explore whether beacon has anomalous login location (fact 3).** - fact 3: beacon has l **if and only if** cipher does not have p. - this creates two branches: ### branch a: cipher has p \u2192 beacon does not have l **step 4: determine who else has p (fact 8: exactly two systems have p).** - cipher has p (branch a assumption). we need exactly one more system with p. - fact 7: atlas has p **only if** beacon has l. in branch a, beacon does not have l, so atlas does not have p. - therefore the second system with p must be either beacon or drift. **step 4a: sub-branch \u2014 beacon has p.** - beacon has p but not l (from branch a). so beacon cannot be the critical incident (needs all three). - cipher has p and d. does cipher have l? if cipher has l, p, and d, cipher is the critical incident candidate. - fact 1 says exactly one system has all three. let's check consistency. - fact 6: drift does not have l. - atlas: no p. drift: no p (only cipher and beacon have p in this sub-branch). so neither atlas nor drift can be the critical incident (fact 4 requires p). - beacon: has p but not l \u2192 not the critical incident. - so the critical incident must be cipher, which requires cipher to have l. - **check: does cipher having l, p, d violate anything?** no fact prohibits cipher from having l. - **check fact 1:** exactly one system has all three. we need to verify no other system has all three. atlas lacks p, beacon lacks l, drift lacks l (fact 6) and lacks p \u2192 confirmed, only cipher has all three. \u2713 - **this sub-branch is consistent.** cipher is the critical incident. **step 4b: sub-branch \u2014 drift has p (instead of beacon).** - drift has p but not l (fact 6). so drift cannot be the critical incident. - cipher has p and d. for cipher to be the critical incident, cipher needs l. - if cipher has l, p, d \u2192 cipher is the critical incident candidate. - check: does any other system have all three? atlas has no p. beacon has no l and no p. drift has no l. \u2192 only cipher could. \u2713 - but wait \u2014 we need to verify fact 1: exactly one system has all three. this also works. - **however**, let me check whether this sub-branch creates any contradiction with fact 2. - cipher has d (fact 5). does drift have d? drift is in the same zone as atlas (fact 2), not cipher. fact 2 only constrains atlas and drift. no contradiction yet. - does atlas have d? if atlas has d, then drift does not (fact 2), and vice versa. this is unconstrained further, so multiple possibilities exist. - **this sub-branch is also consistent with cipher as the critical incident.** so in branch a, **cipher is the critical incident** regardless of which sub-branch. ### branch b: cipher does not have p \u2192 beacon has l **step 5: determine who has p (fact 8: exactly two systems).** - cipher does not have p. so the two systems with p are among {atlas, beacon, drift}. - fact 7: atlas has p only if beacon has l. in branch b, beacon has l, so atlas may have p (not forced, but permitted). - fact 4: the critical incident must have p. since cipher lacks p, cipher cannot be the critical incident. **step 6: identify the critical incident candidate in branch b.** - the critical incident needs l, p, and d (fact 1). - fact 6: drift does not have l \u2192 drift cannot be the critical incident. - so the critical incident is either atlas or beacon. **step 6a: could atlas be the critical incident?** - atlas needs l, p, and d. - if atlas has d, then drift does not have d (fact 2). \u2713 possible. - atlas needs p: permitted since beacon has l (fact 7). \u2713 - atlas needs l: no fact prohibits this. \u2713 - exactly two systems have p. atlas has p; who is the second? must be beacon or drift. - check: does any other system also have all three? we need to ensure exactly one does (fact 1). - beacon has l. if beacon also has p and d, beacon would also have all three \u2192 violates fact 1. - so if atlas is the critical incident, beacon must lack p or lack d (or both). - if beacon lacks p: then the second p-holder is drift. two p-holders: atlas, drift. \u2713 - if beacon has p but lacks d: two p-holders: atlas, beacon. \u2713 - both seem possible on the surface. but let's check further. - **this sub-branch doesn't immediately contradict**, but let's see if branch b itself leads to a unique answer. **step 6b: could beacon be the critical incident?** - beacon needs l (has it \u2713), p, and d. - exactly two systems have p. beacon has p; who is the second? atlas or drift. - if atlas has p: fact 7 says atlas has p only if beacon has l \u2192 beacon has l \u2713, so permitted. - if drift has p: also permitted. - beacon needs d: no fact prohibits this. - check fact 1: no other system should have all three. - atlas: if atlas has l, p, and d \u2192 violation. so we must ensure atlas doesn't have all three. - drift: no l (fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713 - cipher: no p \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713 **step 7: branch b gives multiple candidates (atlas or beacon), so we need additional constraints to resolve or reject branch b.** - fact 1: **exactly one** system has all three indicators. this is a uniqueness constraint but doesn't by itself eliminate branch b. - however, the puzzle states \"exactly one alert is a true critical incident\" and the facts should yield a **unique** answer. let me re-examine whether branch b is actually consistent. **critical check on branch b:** - in branch b, cipher does not have p. cipher has d (fact 5). the critical incident is not cipher. - we need exactly two systems with p from {atlas, beacon, drift}. - let me try atlas as critical incident: atlas has l, p, d. - fact 2: atlas has d \u2192 drift does not have d. \u2713 - second p-holder: beacon or drift. - fact 1: only atlas has all three. so beacon must lack at least one of {p, d} (beacon already has l). - if beacon has p: beacon must lack d. two p-holders: atlas, beacon. \u2713 (fact 8) - if beacon lacks p: second p-holder is drift. two p-holders: atlas, drift. \u2713 - both work. but does any other fact constrain further? let me check all facts: - fact 6: drift no l \u2713 - fact 3: beacon has l iff cipher lacks p \u2192 cipher lacks p \u2713, beacon has l \u2713 - fact 7: atlas has p only if beacon has l \u2192 beacon has l \u2713 - all facts satisfied. - let me try beacon as critical incident: beacon has l, p, d. - second p-holder: atlas or drift. - if atlas has p: fact 7 requires beacon has l \u2713. - does atlas have all three? atlas needs l and d too. if atlas lacks l or d, fine. - fact 2: if atlas has d, drift doesn't. if atlas doesn't have d, no constraint triggered. - this is consistent. - if drift has p: two p-holders: beacon, drift. - fact 7: atlas has p only if beacon has l. atlas doesn't have p. \u2713 (vacuously true) - consistent. **branch b appears to allow multiple solutions, which means the puzzle would be ambiguous if branch b were valid. since the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, let me re-examine whether branch b truly holds up.** **wait \u2014 let me reconsider fact 1 more carefully.** fact 1 says: \"exactly one system has all three indicators.\" this is a given fact, not a definition of the critical incident. fact 4 says: \"any system in the critical incident state must have privileged token use.\" the critical incident is the system with all three indicators (from fact 1, since it's the one that \"must be escalated\"). actually, let me re-read the problem. \"exactly one alert is a true critical incident that must be escalated.\" and fact 1: \"exactly one system has all three indicators.\" the critical incident is the system with all three indicators. fact 4 adds that the critical incident must have p (which is already entailed by having all three, so fact 4 is either redundant or serves to eliminate systems without p from consideration). so the question is: do the facts uniquely determine which system has all three? **let me reconsider whether branch b is actually valid by checking if it leads to a contradiction i missed.** in branch b: cipher does not have p. - fact 8: exactly two systems have p, from {atlas, beacon, drift}. - fact 7: atlas has p \u2192 beacon has l. (beacon has l in branch b, so this is non-restrictive.) - fact 6: drift has no l. let me enumerate the possible pairs with p: 1. {atlas, beacon} 2. {atlas, drift} 3. {beacon, drift} for each, who could have all three (l, p, d)? **case b1: {atlas, beacon} have p.** - atlas: has p. has l? unknown. has d? if yes, drift has no d (fact 2). - beacon: has p, has l. has d? unknown. - for exactly one to have all three: - if atlas has all three: atlas has l, p, d. then beacon must lack d (to not have all three, since beacon has l and p). possible. - if beacon has all three: beacon has l, p, d. then atlas must lack l or d. possible. - could both have all three? only if both have l, p, d. atlas has d \u2192 drift no d (fact 2). beacon has d. cipher has d. so d-holders: atlas, beacon, cipher. that's fine, no rule against it. atlas has l, beacon has l. no rule against both having l. so both could have all three \u2192 violates fact 1. so we need exactly one. - this means: either atlas has all three and beacon doesn't, or beacon has all three and atlas doesn't. two sub-cases, both consistent. **ambiguous.** **case b2: {atlas, drift} have p.** - beacon has l but no p \u2192 beacon can't have all three. - atlas: has p. needs l and d for all three. - drift: has p, no l (fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. - so only atlas can be the critical incident. atlas needs l and d. - atlas has d \u2192 drift no d (fact 2). \u2713 - atlas has l: no prohibition. \u2713 - exactly one with all three: only atlas. \u2713 - **this is consistent. atlas would be the critical incident.** **case b3: {beacon, drift} have p.** - atlas has no p \u2192 can't have all three. - drift has p, no l \u2192 can't have all three. - beacon has p, l. needs d for all three. - beacon has d: no prohibition. \u2713 - exactly one with all three: only beacon. \u2713 - **this is consistent. beacon would be the critical incident.** so branch b gives three possible answers (atlas in b1 or b2, beacon in b1 or b3). this means branch b must be **invalid** for the puzzle to have a unique solution. **therefore branch a must be the correct branch, and cipher is the critical incident.** let me verify: **branch b is invalid** means cipher does have p (negating the branch b assumption that cipher does not have p). **final verification of branch a (cipher has p):** - cipher has p and d (facts 4, 5). - fact 3: beacon has l \u2194 cipher lacks p. cipher has p \u2192 beacon does not have l. - fact 7: atlas has p \u2192 beacon has l. beacon does not have l \u2192 atlas does not have p (contrapositive). - fact 8: exactly two have p. cipher has p, atlas doesn't. so the second is beacon or drift. - fact 1: exactly one system has all three. the critical incident must have p (fact 4). - atlas: no p \u2192 not critical. - beacon: no l \u2192 can't have all three. - drift: no l (fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. - **cipher: has p, has d, needs l.** cipher must have l for exactly one system to have all three. - cipher has l, p, d \u2192 **cipher is the critical incident.** \u2713 - no other system has all three: atlas (no p), beacon (no l), drift (no l). \u2713 - second p-holder: beacon or drift (either works; the puzzle doesn't require us to determine this, and both are consistent). \u2713 **all facts verified. cipher is uniquely the critical incident.** --- # section 3: reusable reasoning procedure for signal-dependent triage puzzles 1. **catalog indicators and constraints.** list all binary signals (present/absent) for each entity. identify biconditionals, conditionals, exclusivity constraints, and cardinality constraints. 2. **apply unconditional facts first.** lock in any signals that are stated as definite (e.g., \"cipher has d,\" \"drift does not have l\"). these reduce the search space immediately. 3. **identify pivot constraints \u2014 biconditionals and cardinality limits.** these create hard branching points. a biconditional (fact 3) forces a binary split. a cardinality constraint (fact 8: exactly two with p) limits combinations. 4. **branch on the pivot and propagate.** for each branch, apply conditionals (especially contrapositives) to derive forced values. chain implications: if a \u2192 b and b \u2192 c, propagate fully before checking consistency. 5. **apply the uniqueness test.** if the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, any branch that permits multiple valid solutions is **invalid** (because the puzzle would be ambiguous). this is a powerful meta-constraint: the correct branch must yield exactly one answer. 6. **verify the surviving branch exhaustively.** check every stated fact against the derived assignment. confirm that the \"exactly one\" and cardinality constraints hold. 7. **document the elimination chain.** for each rejected alternative, state the specific fact or combination of facts that eliminates it. this creates an auditable trail. **key heuristic:** when constraints are partially dependent (signals on one entity affect what's possible on another), always propagate contrapositives immediately \u2014 they often eliminate more possibilities than the original conditional. --- # section 4: real-": 1

Their slide deck assumes rapid user growth will offset lower margins and that customer support costs will remain stable due to automation.\n\nIdentify the implicit assumptions behind this plan and categorize them as market, operational, financial, regulatory, or behavioral assumptions. For each assumption, state what evidence would validate or falsify it within the first two quarters. Then rank the top five risk assumptions by expected downside and propose targeted experiments or safeguards to reduce decision risk before full rollout.\n\nOutput format: assumption table + prioritized risk narrative + next-step validation roadmap.\n",

CSAT drops to 65%; churn accelerates to 8-10%\n- **12-month cost overrun**: $2-4M; profitability target missed by 18+ months\n\n**Why High Risk:**\n- Support costs are **sticky and slow to reverse** (hiring lag, training, infrastructure)\n- Automation assumptions are **untested in new region** (language, payment rails, regulatory Q&A)\n- **Detectability lag**: Churn and CSAT degrade over 8-12 weeks; by then, damage is done\n\n---\n\n### **RISK #2: Influencer Cohort Quality Mismatch (Market/Behavioral)**\n**Probability**: 55% | **Impact**: -$1.5-3M CAC waste | **Detectability Gap**: MEDIUM-HIGH (Q2-Q3)\n\n**Downside Scenario:**\n- Influencer audiences are 40-50% outside ICP (e.g., price-sensitive, non-enterprise, geographic mismatch)\n- Influencer-sourced CAC is $250-400 vs. assumed $100-150\n- Cohort churn is 8-12% vs. baseline 3-5% (low-quality users, price-sensitive, low intent)\n- By Q2, influencer spend ($500K-1M) has generated 2,000-3,000 users with 50%+ churn by month 6\n- **Effective CAC**: $400-600 per retained user; LTV:CAC <1.5:1 (unprofitable)\n\n**Why High Risk:**\n- **Influencer selection is subjective** and hard to validate pre-launch\n- Cohort quality **lags by 6-8 weeks** (churn curves take time to materialize)\n- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Pressure to continue spend even as data turns negative\n\n---\n\n### **RISK #3: Competitor Price War (Market)**\n**Probability**: 60% | **Impact**: -$3-5M revenue + margin compression | **Detectability Gap**: MEDIUM (Q1-Q2)\n\n**Downside Scenario:**\n- Incumbent competitor or new entrant responds to 30% price cut with 25-35% cut of their own\n- Market becomes commoditized; price becomes primary differentiator\n- Company's margin advantage disappears; gross margin drops from 65% to 45-50%\n- Growth target requires even deeper discounts or higher CAC spend\n- **12-month impact**: Revenue growth stalls at 15-20% (vs. 50%+ target); profitability pushed to 18-24 months\n\n**Why High Risk:**\n- **Competitors have visibility** into pricing moves within weeks\n- **Margin compression is irreversible** in short term (hard to raise prices)\n- **Detectability is fast** but **response options are limited** (can't un-cut prices)\n\n---\n\n### **RISK #4: Localization & Regulatory Friction (Operational/Regulatory)**\n**Probability**: 50% | **Impact**: -$500K-1.5M + 6-month delay | **Detectability Gap**: HIGH (Q2-Q3)**\n\n**Downside Scenario:**\n- Regional market requires 15-25% product loc",

Projected average summer indoor temperature reduction: 1.8\u00b0C for participating buildings. Uneven uptake expected.\nProposal B: Expand tree canopy in heat-vulnerable districts. Estimated cost: $40M over 4 years. Projected district-level surface temperature reduction: 1.1\u00b0C, plus long-term air-quality co-benefits. Slower initial impact and maintenance uncertainty.\n\nProvide a decision memo that identifies tradeoffs across equity, time-to-impact, durability, measurement uncertainty, and political feasibility. Include a recommendation with a risk-mitigation plan and at least three measurable indicators the city should track for adaptive policy revision. Do not assume both can be funded.\n",

The objective is to recommend the most effective and equitable strategy, acknowledging inherent trade-offs and providing a framework for adaptive policy management.\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nBoth proposals offer viable pathways to reduce urban heat, but with distinct characteristics. Proposal A offers a faster, more direct indoor temperature reduction for participating buildings, but faces equity challenges due to uneven uptake. Proposal B provides broader, district-level cooling and significant co-benefits, but with a slower initial impact and maintenance uncertainties.\n\n**Recommendation:** While both proposals have merit, **Proposal B (Expand Tree Canopy in Heat-Vulnerable Districts)** is recommended as the primary strategy. This recommendation prioritizes long-term, equitable, and widespread impact, despite its slower initial realization and maintenance considerations. A robust risk mitigation plan and clear performance indicators are crucial for its successful implementation.\n\n### Proposal Analysis\n\n| Feature             | Proposal A: Cool Roof Subsidies",

Your explanation should focus on phosphorescence (not fluorescence), stay scientifically accurate, and avoid misleading claims.\n\nRequirements:\n- Use at least two different metaphors and briefly compare their strengths/limits.\n- Include one short interactive thought experiment the child can do at home using safe, common objects.\n- Include a \"what scientists still don't fully know\" section in age-appropriate language.\n- End with one question that invites further curiosity.\n\nTone should be encouraging, precise, and imaginative.\n",

But then, something amazing happened. A giant map of the stars painted on the far wall began to glow with a soft, green light.\n\n\u201cWhoa!

Instead of gobbling it all at once, they save it, releasing the energy very slowly as a gentle glow. Or, a better metaphor: picture the light knocking tiny balls up onto a high, sticky shelf. In most materials, the balls fall right back down. But in this paint, the shelf is so sticky that the balls get trapped for a while, only falling down one by one, releasing a little bit of light each time they drop.\u201d\n\nThe snack metaphor is simple, but materials don\u2019t get \u201cfull.\u201d The sticky shelf metaphor is better because it helps explain the *delay*\u2014the energy gets stuck!\n\n**Try This at Home:** Take a glow-in-the-dark toy into a dark closet.

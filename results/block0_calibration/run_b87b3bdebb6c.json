uses existing HR/payroll systems and a city-run credit framework.  \n2) **Variable Curb-Access Permits (Delivery/Taxi/Private) by Blockface** \u2014 Targets a major hidden cause of congestion (curb friction) with relatively fast operational rollout.  \n3) **Traffic Signal \u201cAuction\u201d for Green-Time Priority (Buses/Freight/Carpools) with Equity Guardrails** \u2014 High leverage on throughput using software/policy; political risk is manageable with constraints.  \n4) **Neighborhood Through-Traffic \u201cFilters\u201d that Move Weekly (Tactical, Mobile Street Design)** \u2014 Can cut rat-running quickly, but backlash/local politics can be intense.  \n5) **Behavioral \u201cCongestion Coach\u201d + Micro-rewards for Not Driving at Peak** \u2014 Easy to pilot and scale; impact is moderate unless paired with strong incentives.\n\n---\n\n# 1) Employer \u201cCommute Slot\u201d Market + Compliance Credits (pricing/governance)\n\n**Concept summary**  \nCreate a citywide program where large employers (and optionally universities/hospitals) must manage *peak-period commute slots* the way they manage parking permits: each employer gets a cap of \u201cpeak-trip credits\u201d and can trade credits or earn more by shifting schedules, hybrid days, or verified mode-shift.\n\n**Mechanism of action**  \n- Peak congestion is a coordination failure: too many people choose the same 60\u201390 minutes.  \n- The city allocates a declining budget of \u201cpeak-trip credits\u201d based on headcount and location; employers must cover employee peak arrivals/departures (self-reported + periodic verification, or anonymized mobility data).  \n- Employers can:  \n  - Stagger start times, formalize hybrid schedules, run internal shuttles, offer cash-out for parking, or subsidize off-peak commuting.  \n  - Buy/sell credits to other employers (creating a price signal).  \n- Unlike a blanket congestion charge, this targets *institutions* that can coordinate behavior.\n\n**Expected upside**  \n- Rapid peak spreading (often 5\u201315% reduction in peak demand is enough to dramatically improve flow).  \n- Politically easier than charging individuals directly; negotiations happen with a few hundred entities instead of millions of drivers.  \n- Produces predictable, measurable peak reduction.\n\n**Biggest failure mode**  \nEmployers game reporting or simply pass costs to employees (e.g., punitive scheduling) without real congestion relief; also, small employers may be left out, limiting coverage.\n\n**Equity implications**  \n- Risk: shift burden onto hourly workers with less schedule control.  \n- Mitigations: require \u201cworker-protection\u201d rules (e.g., no involuntary split shifts; schedule changes with minimum notice), and grant extra credits for employers with higher shares of essential/on-site roles.  \n- Provide an \u201cequity pool\u201d of credits for hospitals/low-wage-heavy sectors and fund last-mile solutions where alternatives are weak.\n\n**First 90-day pilot design**  \n- **Scope:** 20\u201340 large employers in the most congested corridor(s), voluntary but with strong perks (public recognition, expedited permits, modest tax/fee discounts).  \n- **Metric:** change in peak vehicle counts and travel times on adjacent arterials; employer-reported peak arrival distributions.  \n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Week 1\u20133: baseline measurement; sign MOUs; define \u201cpeak\u201d windows.  \n  - Week 4\u20136: allocate initial credits; set up a simple trading platform (could be spreadsheet + clearinghouse initially).  \n  - Week 7\u201312: employers implement at least two measures (staggered shifts, 2 remote days, parking cash-out, off-peak bonus).  \n- **Success threshold:** measurable peak spreading (e.g., \u22658% reduction in arrivals 8\u20139am at participating sites) and corridor speed improvement (e.g., +10% average peak speed).\n\n**Why ranked #1**  \nHigh leverage on the root cause (synchronized demand) with modest infrastructure needs; implementation is governance-heavy but operationally feasible via a limited number of institutions.\n\n---\n\n# 2) Variable Curb-Access Permits by Blockface (street operations + pricing)\n\n**Concept summary**  \nTreat curb space as a managed, priced access system\u2014by block, time, and vehicle type\u2014so double-parking and cruising for pickup/drop-off are replaced by reservable, enforced curb slots.\n\n**Mechanism of action**  \n- A large share of \u201ccongestion\u201d is actually friction: double-parked deliveries, ridehail stopping in travel lanes, and cars circling for curb access.  \n- Create **digital curb permits**:  \n  - Delivery and ridehail vehicles must book (or be assigned) 2\u201310 minute curb slots on designated loading segments.  \n  - Prices vary dynamically by demand; revenue funds enforcement and neighborhood improvements.  \n- Enforcement uses license-plate recognition + quick-response \u201ccurb marshals\u201d rather than relying only on police.\n\n**Expected upside**  \n- Immediate reduction in blocked lanes and stop-and-go shockwaves.  \n- Improves bus reliability and general traffic flow without major construction.  \n- Creates data on curb demand to iteratively reallocate space.\n\n**Biggest failure mode**  \nIf enforcement is weak, compliant operators pay while scofflaws keep double-parking; or if booking UX is bad, it becomes a bureaucratic mess and businesses revolt.\n\n**Equity implications**  \n- Risk: higher costs passed to consumers or small businesses; gig drivers penalized.  \n- Mitigations: free/discounted permits for small local merchants up to a threshold; \u201cdriver hardship\u201d exemptions; dedicate a portion of revenue to safer sidewalks/loading zones in underserved areas.\n\n**First 90-day pilot design**  \n- **Scope:** 1\u20132 dense commercial districts + one mixed-use corridor.  \n- **Design:** convert ~10\u201320% of curb length on selected blocks into signed \u201cManaged Loading\u201d with strict hours.  \n- **Tech:** start with a simple QR/signage + web booking; integrate with major delivery firms later.  \n- **Enforcement:** hire/assign a small curb team with authority to ticket/tow quickly; publish weekly compliance stats.  \n- **Metrics:** double-parking minutes, bus/traffic speeds, delivery dwell time, merchant satisfaction.  \n- **Success threshold:** \u226550% reduction in observed double-parking and measurable corridor speed gain during peaks.\n\n**Why ranked #2**  \nHigh congestion payoff in dense areas and operationally pilotable; main constraint is credible enforcement, which is solvable with dedicated staffing and clear rules.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Traffic Signal \u201cAuction\u201d for Green-Time Priority with Guardrails (governance + tech)\n\n**Concept summary**  \nAllocate scarce intersection green time via a rule-based \u201cpriority market\u201d where certain trips (buses, freight, carpools, paratransit) can buy/earn priority\u2014within safety and fairness constraints\u2014rather than fixed signal timing plans that ignore real-time value.\n\n**Mechanism of action**  \n- Intersections are bottlenecks; current control treats all demand similarly, even when societal value differs.  \n- Create a **priority layer** on adaptive signals:  \n  - Vehicles with certified transponders (bus, freight fleet, HOV app) can request priority.  \n  - Priority is granted based on a price/credit and rules (max delays to side streets, pedestrian minimums).  \n  - Revenues/fees can fund credits for buses and low-income users.  \n- This reframes signal priority from \u201cspecial treatment\u201d to \u201cmanaged scarce resource.\u201d\n\n**Expected upside**  \n- Increases throughput where it matters; reduces bus bunching; improves freight reliability (which reduces random stopping and curb chaos).  \n- Generates measurable data on intersection value and delay tradeoffs.\n\n**Biggest failure mode**  \nPerception of \u201cthe rich buying green lights\u201d or safety concerns if poorly tuned; also risk of vendor complexity and procurement delays.\n\n**Equity implications**  \n- Risk: unfair advantage if priced access is dominated by well-funded fleets.  \n- Mitigations:  \n  - Give buses/paratransit default free priority.  \n  - Provide income-based credits for eligible carpools.  \n  - Hard caps on how much any class can \u201cwin\u201d per hour; transparent reporting.\n\n**First 90-day pilot design**  \n- **Scope:** 10\u201320 intersections on a corridor with mixed bus + freight + high congestion.  \n- **Implementation:**  \n  - Use existing signal controllers if possible; otherwise add an overlay system.  \n  - Recruit 1\u20132 freight fleets + city buses; optionally a carpool app cohort.  \n- **Rules:** pedestrian safety minima; max red time limits; emergency vehicle override.  \n- **Metrics:** person-throughput per hour, bus on-time performance, average intersection delay, side-street delay distribution.  \n- **Success threshold:** \u22655\u201310% increase in corridor person-throughput with no more than X seconds added average side-street delay and no safety regressions.\n\n**Why ranked #3**  \nPotentially very high leverage, but political optics and technical integration risk reduce feasibility compared with employer/curb programs.\n\n---\n\n# 4) Mobile \u201cRat-Run Filters\u201d + Weekly Rotation (street-design intervention)\n\n**Concept summary**  \nDeploy a rotating set of low-cost, movable traffic diverters (\u201cfilters\u201d) that prevent through-traffic on residential streets during peak hours\u2014then rotate locations weekly based on observed diversion patterns to avoid simply displacing the problem.\n\n**Mechanism of action**  \n- Congestion cascades when drivers divert to neighborhood grids, causing widespread friction and re-feeding arterials at awkward points.  \n- Install temporary filters (planters, water barriers, camera-enforced turn restrictions) to make local streets truly local during peak times.  \n- Rotation prevents a stable \u201cnew shortcut\u201d from emerging and makes the system adaptive.\n\n**Expected upside**  \n- Quick reduction in cut-through traffic and intersection conflicts.  \n- Forces traffic back to arterials designed for it, which can be managed more efficiently with signals and curb management.  \n- Low capital; rapid iteration.\n\n**Biggest failure mode**  \nPolitical backlash from residents on boundary streets and from drivers; emergency services concerns; if arterials are already failing, pushing more traffic back can worsen them unless paired with signal/curb fixes.\n\n**Equity implications**  \n- Risk: boundary roads (often lower-income) get more traffic/noise if not carefully designed.  \n- Mitigations: equity-first selection (protect vulnerable neighborhoods *and* avoid concentrating impacts), continuous monitoring, and compensatory measures on boundary arterials (crossing safety, noise mitigation, enforcement).\n\n**First 90-day pilot design**  \n- **Scope:** 2\u20133 neighborhoods with documented cut-through during peak.  \n- **Week 1\u20132:** baseline counts (local vs through), speed, crashes/near-misses, noise.  \n- **Week 3\u201310:** deploy 6\u201312 filter locations, rotating weekly among a pre-published set; use clear signage and navigation app coordination.  \n- **Week 11\u201313:** lock in best-performing configuration (or remove).  \n- **Metrics:** through-traffic reduction on local streets, arterial travel time, emergency response times, resident surveys.  \n- **Success threshold:** \u226530\u201350% reduction in cut-through volumes with neutral/positive arterial performance and no emergency response degradation.\n\n**Why ranked #4**  \nStreet-design pilots are fast and cheap, but backlash risk is real and can kill scale-up even if the traffic results are strong.\n\n---\n\n# 5) \u201cCongestion Coach\u201d + Micro-rewards for Off-Peak/Not Driving (behavioral)\n\n**Concept summary**  \nOffer residents a voluntary program that gives highly specific, personalized weekly challenges (leave 25 minutes earlier twice this week; bundle errands; remote meeting day) and pays small but immediate rewards\u2014funded by sponsors or congestion revenues\u2014verified via phone telemetry.\n\n**Mechanism of action**  \n- Many peak trips are flexible but not perceived as such.  \n- Behavioral science levers: defaults, timely prompts, loss aversion, and micro-rewards that are immediate (coffee credit, mobile data top-up, parking discount off-peak).  \n- Focus on \u201cpeak shedding\u201d rather than total VMT: even small peak reductions unlock big flow improvements.\n\n**Expected upside**  \n- Fast to launch; relatively non-coercive; builds a culture of peak awareness.  \n- Generates granular data on which nudges actually move behavior in this city.\n\n**Biggest failure mode**  \nLow sustained engagement; privacy concerns; selection bias (only already-flexible people join), limiting congestion impact.\n\n**Equity implications**  \n- Risk: benefits accrue to people with flexible jobs; those who must travel at peak can\u2019t earn rewards.  \n- Mitigations: create alternative reward paths (e.g., verified carpooling, combining trips, shifting even 10 minutes), and prioritize sign-ups/rewards in lower-income ZIPs; avoid punitive framing.\n\n**First 90-day pilot design**  \n- **Scope:** 10,000\u201330,000 volunteers recruited through employers, universities, and utility bills.  \n- **Design:** randomized A/B testing of prompts and reward types; strict privacy (on-device processing, anonymized aggregation).  \n- **Rewards:** $1\u2013$3 equivalent per achieved target, capped weekly; bigger \u201cstreak\u201d bonuses.  \n- **Metrics:** peak-period trip rate among participants vs control, corridor speed correlations, retention at 30/60/90 days.  \n- **Success threshold:** sustained \u22658\u201312% reduction in participant peak trips and evidence of corridor-level improvement if scaled.\n\n**Why ranked #5**  \nVery feasible and politically palatable, but typically produces modest aggregate effects unless paired with stronger pricing/management tools.\n\n---\n\n## Self-critical notes (what I\u2019m least certain about)\n- **Employer commute credits** can be powerful, but only if the city can define/verify \u201cpeak trips\u201d without triggering privacy backlash; the pilot must prove measurement credibility early.  \n- **Signal priority auctions** are conceptually elegant but procurement and \u201cpay-to-win\u201d optics can derail them; guardrails and transparency are non-negotiable.  \n- **Rotating filters** are intentionally provocative; they work best when coupled with parallel arterial management so the city isn\u2019t just moving queues around.\n\nIf you tell me the city\u2019s dominant trip generators (CBD-heavy vs polycentric), car ownership rate, and whether ridehail/deliveries are major contributors, I can tailor the five interventions and pilot geographies more tightly.",

bundle errands; remote meeting day) and pays small but immediate rewards\u2014funded by sponsors or congestion revenues\u2014verified via phone telemetry.\n\n**Mechanism of action**  \n- Many peak trips are flexible but not perceived as such.  \n- Behavioral science levers: defaults, timely prompts, loss aversion, and micro-rewards that are immediate (coffee credit, mobile data top-up, parking discount off-peak).  \n- Focus on \u201cpeak shedding\u201d rather than total VMT: even small peak reductions unlock big flow improvements.\n\n**Expected upside**  \n- Fast to launch; relatively non-coercive; builds a culture of peak awareness.  \n- Generates granular data on which nudges actually move behavior in this city.\n\n**Biggest failure mode**  \nLow sustained engagement; privacy concerns; selection bias (only already-flexible people join), limiting congestion impact.\n\n**Equity implications**  \n- Risk: benefits accrue to people with flexible jobs; those who must travel at peak can\u2019t earn rewards.  \n- Mitigations: create alternative reward paths (e.g., verified carpooling, combining trips, shifting even 10 minutes), and prioritize sign-ups/rewards in lower-income ZIPs; avoid punitive framing.\n\n**First 90-day pilot design**  \n- **Scope:** 10,000\u201330,000 volunteers recruited through employers, universities, and utility bills.  \n- **Design:** randomized A/B testing of prompts and reward types; strict privacy (on-device processing, anonymized aggregation).  \n- **Rewards:** $1\u2013$3 equivalent per achieved target, capped weekly; bigger \u201cstreak\u201d bonuses.  \n- **Metrics:** peak-period trip rate among participants vs control, corridor speed correlations, retention at 30/60/90 days.  \n- **Success threshold:** sustained \u22658\u201312% reduction in participant peak trips and evidence of corridor-level improvement if scaled.\n\n**Why ranked #5**  \nVery feasible and politically palatable, but typically produces modest aggregate effects unless paired with stronger pricing/management tools.\n\n---\n\n## Self-critical notes (what I\u2019m least certain about)\n- **Employer commute credits** can be powerful, but only if the city can define/verify \u201cpeak trips\u201d without triggering privacy backlash; the pilot must prove measurement credibility early.  \n- **Signal priority auctions** are conceptually elegant but procurement and \u201cpay-to-win\u201d optics can derail them; guardrails and transparency are non-negotiable.  \n- **Rotating filters** are intentionally provocative;

        "## ranked interventions (impact-to-feasibility ratio) 1) **employer \u201ccommute slot\u201d market + compliance credits** \u2014 big demand-shaping effect with limited capital spend; uses existing hr/payroll systems and a city-run credit framework. 2) **variable curb-access permits (delivery/taxi/private) by blockface** \u2014 targets a major hidden cause of congestion (curb friction) with relatively fast operational rollout. 3) **traffic signal \u201cauction\u201d for green-time priority (buses/freight/carpools) with equity guardrails** \u2014 high leverage on throughput using software/policy; political risk is manageable with constraints. 4) **neighborhood through-traffic \u201cfilters\u201d that move weekly (tactical, mobile street design)** \u2014 can cut rat-running quickly, but backlash/local politics can be intense. 5) **behavioral \u201ccongestion coach\u201d + micro-rewards for not driving at peak** \u2014 easy to pilot and scale; impact is moderate unless paired with strong incentives. --- # 1) employer \u201ccommute slot\u201d market + compliance credits (pricing/governance) **concept summary** create a citywide program where large employers (and optionally universities/hospitals) must manage *peak-period commute slots* the way they manage parking permits: each employer gets a cap of \u201cpeak-trip credits\u201d and can trade credits or earn more by shifting schedules, hybrid days, or verified mode-shift. **mechanism of action** - peak congestion is a coordination failure: too many people choose the same 60\u201390 minutes. - the city allocates a declining budget of \u201cpeak-trip credits\u201d based on headcount and location; employers must cover employee peak arrivals/departures (self-reported + periodic verification, or anonymized mobility data). - employers can: - stagger start times, formalize hybrid schedules, run internal shuttles, offer cash-out for parking, or subsidize off-peak commuting. - buy/sell credits to other employers (creating a price signal). - unlike a blanket congestion charge, this targets *institutions* that can coordinate behavior. **expected upside** - rapid peak spreading (often 5\u201315% reduction in peak demand is enough to dramatically improve flow). - politically easier than charging individuals directly; negotiations happen with a few hundred entities instead of millions of drivers. - produces predictable, measurable peak reduction. **biggest failure mode** employers game reporting or simply pass costs to employees (e.g., punitive scheduling) without real congestion relief; also, small employers may be left out, limiting coverage. **equity implications** - risk: shift burden onto hourly workers with less schedule control. - mitigations: require \u201cworker-protection\u201d rules (e.g., no involuntary split shifts; schedule changes with minimum notice), and grant extra credits for employers with higher shares of essential/on-site roles. - provide an \u201cequity pool\u201d of credits for hospitals/low-wage-heavy sectors and fund last-mile solutions where alternatives are weak. **first 90-day pilot design** - **scope:** 20\u201340 large employers in the most congested corridor(s), voluntary but with strong perks (public recognition, expedited permits, modest tax/fee discounts). - **metric:** change in peak vehicle counts and travel times on adjacent arterials; employer-reported peak arrival distributions. - **implementation:** - week 1\u20133: baseline measurement; sign mous; define \u201cpeak\u201d windows. - week 4\u20136: allocate initial credits; set up a simple trading platform (could be spreadsheet + clearinghouse initially). - week 7\u201312: employers implement at least two measures (staggered shifts, 2 remote days, parking cash-out, off-peak bonus). - **success threshold:** measurable peak spreading (e.g., \u22658% reduction in arrivals 8\u20139am at participating sites) and corridor speed improvement (e.g., +10% average peak speed). **why ranked #1** high leverage on the root cause (synchronized demand) with modest infrastructure needs; implementation is governance-heavy but operationally feasible via a limited number of institutions. --- # 2) variable curb-access permits by blockface (street operations + pricing) **concept summary** treat curb space as a managed, priced access system\u2014by block, time, and vehicle type\u2014so double-parking and cruising for pickup/drop-off are replaced by reservable, enforced curb slots. **mechanism of action** - a large share of \u201ccongestion\u201d is actually friction: double-parked deliveries, ridehail stopping in travel lanes, and cars circling for curb access. - create **digital curb permits**: - delivery and ridehail vehicles must book (or be assigned) 2\u201310 minute curb slots on designated loading segments. - prices vary dynamically by demand; revenue funds enforcement and neighborhood improvements. - enforcement uses license-plate recognition + quick-response \u201ccurb marshals\u201d rather than relying only on police. **expected upside** - immediate reduction in blocked lanes and stop-and-go shockwaves. - improves bus reliability and general traffic flow without major construction. - creates data on curb demand to iteratively reallocate space. **biggest failure mode** if enforcement is weak, compliant operators pay while scofflaws keep double-parking; or if booking ux is bad, it becomes a bureaucratic mess and businesses revolt. **equity implications** - risk: higher costs passed to consumers or small businesses; gig drivers penalized. - mitigations: free/discounted permits for small local merchants up to a threshold; \u201cdriver hardship\u201d exemptions; dedicate a portion of revenue to safer sidewalks/loading zones in underserved areas. **first 90-day pilot design** - **scope:** 1\u20132 dense commercial districts + one mixed-use corridor. - **design:** convert ~10\u201320% of curb length on selected blocks into signed \u201cmanaged loading\u201d with strict hours. - **tech:** start with a simple qr/signage + web booking; integrate with major delivery firms later. - **enforcement:** hire/assign a small curb team with authority to ticket/tow quickly; publish weekly compliance stats. - **metrics:** double-parking minutes, bus/traffic speeds, delivery dwell time, merchant satisfaction. - **success threshold:** \u226550% reduction in observed double-parking and measurable corridor speed gain during peaks. **why ranked #2** high congestion payoff in dense areas and operationally pilotable; main constraint is credible enforcement, which is solvable with dedicated staffing and clear rules. --- # 3) traffic signal \u201cauction\u201d for green-time priority with guardrails (governance + tech) **concept summary** allocate scarce intersection green time via a rule-based \u201cpriority market\u201d where certain trips (buses, freight, carpools, paratransit) can buy/earn priority\u2014within safety and fairness constraints\u2014rather than fixed signal timing plans that ignore real-time value. **mechanism of action** - intersections are bottlenecks; current control treats all demand similarly, even when societal value differs. - create a **priority layer** on adaptive signals: - vehicles with certified transponders (bus, freight fleet, hov app) can request priority. - priority is granted based on a price/credit and rules (max delays to side streets, pedestrian minimums). - revenues/fees can fund credits for buses and low-income users. - this reframes signal priority from \u201cspecial treatment\u201d to \u201cmanaged scarce resource.\u201d **expected upside** - increases throughput where it matters; reduces bus bunching; improves freight reliability (which reduces random stopping and curb chaos). - generates measurable data on intersection value and delay tradeoffs. **biggest failure mode** perception of \u201cthe rich buying green lights\u201d or safety concerns if poorly tuned; also risk of vendor complexity and procurement delays. **equity implications** - risk: unfair advantage if priced access is dominated by well-funded fleets. - mitigations: - give buses/paratransit default free priority. - provide income-based credits for eligible carpools. - hard caps on how much any class can \u201cwin\u201d per hour; transparent reporting. **first 90-day pilot design** - **scope:** 10\u201320 intersections on a corridor with mixed bus + freight + high congestion. - **implementation:** - use existing signal controllers if possible; otherwise add an overlay system. - recruit 1\u20132 freight fleets + city buses; optionally a carpool app cohort. - **rules:** pedestrian safety minima; max red time limits; emergency vehicle override. - **metrics:** person-throughput per hour, bus on-time performance, average intersection delay, side-street delay distribution. - **success threshold:** \u22655\u201310% increase in corridor person-throughput with no more than x seconds added average side-street delay and no safety regressions. **why ranked #3** potentially very high leverage, but political optics and technical integration risk reduce feasibility compared with employer/curb programs. --- # 4) mobile \u201crat-run filters\u201d + weekly rotation (street-design intervention) **concept summary** deploy a rotating set of low-cost, movable traffic diverters (\u201cfilters\u201d) that prevent through-traffic on residential streets during peak hours\u2014then rotate locations weekly based on observed diversion patterns to avoid simply displacing the problem. **mechanism of action** - congestion cascades when drivers divert to neighborhood grids, causing widespread friction and re-feeding arterials at awkward points. - install temporary filters (planters, water barriers, camera-enforced turn restrictions) to make local streets truly local during peak times. - rotation prevents a stable \u201cnew shortcut\u201d from emerging and makes the system adaptive. **expected upside** - quick reduction in cut-through traffic and intersection conflicts. - forces traffic back to arterials designed for it, which can be managed more efficiently with signals and curb management. - low capital; rapid iteration. **biggest failure mode** political backlash from residents on boundary streets and from drivers; emergency services concerns; if arterials are already failing, pushing more traffic back can worsen them unless paired with signal/curb fixes. **equity implications** - risk: boundary roads (often lower-income) get more traffic/noise if not carefully designed. - mitigations: equity-first selection (protect vulnerable neighborhoods *and* avoid concentrating impacts), continuous monitoring, and compensatory measures on boundary arterials (crossing safety, noise mitigation, enforcement). **first 90-day pilot design** - **scope:** 2\u20133 neighborhoods with documented cut-through during peak. - **week 1\u20132:** baseline counts (local vs through), speed, crashes/near-misses, noise. - **week 3\u201310:** deploy 6\u201312 filter locations, rotating weekly among a pre-published set;

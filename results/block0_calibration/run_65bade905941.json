The company highlights p < 0.05 from a paired t-test and concludes broad effectiveness.\n\nCritically evaluate this claim. Identify methodological threats to validity, explain why the statistical significance result is insufficient for the causal claim, and propose a minimally credible redesign that could be executed within one school term.

Internal Validity Threats (Causal Inference)\n\n| Threat | Mechanism | Impact |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| **Selection bias** | Volunteers self-select; likely more motivated, engaged, or struggling students | Score gains may reflect motivation, not tutor efficacy |\n| **Maturation** | Two weeks of any tutoring/practice improves performance naturally | Confounded with treatment effect |\n| **Practice effects** | Students familiar with exam format on second attempt | Inflates post-test scores independent of tutor |\n| **Regression to the mean** | If students selected because scores were low, natural variation produces upward drift | Baseline 64 is suspiciously low; regression artifact likely |\n| **Hawthorne effect** | Volunteer students aware they're in a trial; increased effort/attention | Effect attributable to observation, not tutor quality |\n| **Instrumentation** | Pre/post exams not equated for difficulty | A harder pre-test and easier post-test mechanically inflate gains |\n\n### B. External Validity Threats (Generalizability)\n\n- **Volunteer sample**: Non-representative; excludes disengaged students most needing help\n- **Two-week window**: Insufficient to assess durability; gains may be temporary\n- **No context specification**: Unknown subject, student demographics, baseline ability distribution\n- **Novelty effect**: New technology may produce short-term enthusiasm boost\n\n---\n\n## II. Why Statistical Significance \u2260 Causal Claim\n\n### The p-value Problem\n\n**What p < 0.05 actually means:**\n- Probability of observing this mean difference (or larger) *if the null hypothesis is true* and all assumptions hold\n- Does NOT indicate effect size, practical significance, or causation\n- Assumes random assignment (violated here)\n\n**Why it's misleading here:**\n\n1. **Multiple confounds are correlated with the outcome.** A paired t-test assumes the only difference between pre and post is the treatment. Here, at minimum:\n   - Motivation (volunteer effect)\n   - Practice/familiarity with exam format\n   - Possible exam difficulty differences\n   \n   All inflate the observed difference.\n\n2. **Statistical significance \u2260 treatment effect.** The 16-point gain reflects:\n   - True tutor effect (unknown magnitude)\n   - Selection bias (unknown magnitude)\n   - Practice effects (unknown magnitude)\n   - Possible instrumentation bias (unknown direction)\n   \n   The p-value does not decompose these.\n\n3. **No baseline equivalence.** Without random assignment or matched controls, we cannot attribute the difference to the tutor.\n\n**Analogy:** If I measure my height before and after wearing platform shoes, find a significant difference (p < 0.05), I cannot conclude the shoes caused growth\u2014the measurement method changed.\n\n---\n\n## III. Minimally Credible Redesign (One School Term)\n\n### A. Study Design: Cluster Randomized Quasi-Experiment\n\n**Rationale:** Full RCT may be infeasible (ethical concerns about withholding tutoring); cluster design reduces contamination and is administratively realistic.\n\n### B. Sampling & Randomization\n\n**Population:**\n- Target: 4\u20136 intact classrooms (n \u2248 120\u2013180 students) in a single school/district\n- Inclusion: All students in selected classes (no self-selection)\n- Stratify by baseline performance quartile to ensure balanced groups\n\n**Randomization:**\n- Randomize **classrooms** (not individuals) to:\n  - **Treatment:** AI tutor + standard instruction (8\u201310 weeks)\n  - **Control:** Standard instruction only\n- Minimum 2 classrooms per arm (ideally 3 each)\n- Document randomization process; publish allocation before outcome analysis\n\n**Rationale:** Avoids ethical concerns, reduces peer-effect contamination, maintains ecological validity.\n\n---\n\n### C. Outcome Measurement\n\n**Primary outcome:**\n- **Standardized exam** (same for all students, administered by independent proctor)\n- Administer pre-test (baseline), mid-point (week 4), post-test (week 10)\n- Use **parallel forms** of equal difficulty (validated via pilot or item-response theory)\n- Blind graders to treatment assignment\n\n**Secondary outcomes:**\n- **Engagement metrics:** Time-on-task, assignment completion (objective, platform-recorded)\n- **Durability:** Retention test 4 weeks post-intervention\n- **Heterogeneity:** Stratified analysis by baseline performance quartile (does tutor help low performers more?)\n\n**Measurement quality:**\n- Pre-register exam difficulty equivalence check (e.g., Rasch analysis)\n- Report effect sizes (Cohen's d) and 95% CIs, not just p-values\n\n---\n\n### D. Pre-Registration & Analysis Plan\n\n**Pre-register (before outcome data are locked):**\n1. Primary hypothesis: Treatment group mean \u2265 control group mean + 5 percentile points (conservative, realistic)\n2. Primary analysis: ANCOVA with baseline score as covariate, classroom as random effect\n3. Secondary analyses: Stratified by baseline quartile; intent-to-treat (all enrolled students)\n4. Stopping rule: No interim analyses; analyze after all post-tests collected\n5. Sensitivity analyses: Exclude students with <80% attendance; exclude outliers (\u00b13 SD)\n\n**Transparency:**\n- Register on OSF or AsPredicted before data collection\n- Report all outcomes, including null findings\n- Publish pre-test equivalence table\n\n---\n\n### E. Timeline (One School Term \u2248 15 weeks)\n\n| Week | Activity |\n|------|----------|\n| 1\u20132 | Recruit schools, randomize classrooms, develop parallel exams, pre-register |\n| 3 | Administer baseline exam, begin intervention |\n| 7 | Mid-point exam (check fidelity, engagement) |\n| 12 | Post-intervention exam |\n| 13\u201314 | Retention test; data cleaning, analysis |\n| 15 | Report findings |\n\n---\n\n## IV. What the Current Evidence Actually Justifies\n\n### Honest Claim (Supported by Data):\n\n> \"In a small volunteer sample (n=40) over two weeks, students using our AI tutor showed a 16-point average increase on an unvalidated exam, with a statistically significant paired t-test (p < 0.05). **This does not establish that the tutor caused the improvement**, as the study lacked a control group, random assignment, and exam difficulty controls. The result is consistent with selection bias, practice effects, and measurement artifacts. Causal claims require a controlled trial.\"\n\n### What Should Be Communicated to Stakeholders:\n\n- \u2705 \"Preliminary signal of potential benefit; warrants rigorous testing\"\n- \u274c \"Proven 25% improvement in exam scores\"\n- \u274c \"Statistically significant, therefore effective\"\n\n---\n\n## V. Summary Table: Threats & Mitigations\n\n| Threat | Current Study | Proposed Redesign |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Selection bias | Volunteers only | All students in randomized classrooms |\n| No control | None | Randomized control group |\n| Practice effects | Same exam format pre/post | Parallel forms, equated difficulty |\n| Regression to mean | Baseline 64 (low) | Stratified randomization; ANCOVA |\n| Instrumentation | Exams not equated | Validated parallel forms, blind grading |\n| Hawthorne effect | Volunteers aware | All students; blinded outcome assessment |\n| Generalizability | 2 weeks, unclear context | Full term, specified population |\n\n---\n\n## VI. Conclusion\n\nThe startup's claim conflates **statistical significance with causal efficacy**. The p-value is a red herring; it reflects noise reduction in a biased sample, not proof of treatment effect. The 16-point gain is almost entirely attributable to selection bias, practice effects, and possible measurement artifacts.\n\n**The minimally credible redesign** uses cluster randomization (practical for schools), parallel exams (controls instrumentation), pre-registration (prevents p-hacking), and stratified analysis (detects heterogeneous effects). This can be executed in one term and would provide evidence suitable for marketing claims.\n\n**Until then:** The honest claim is \"promising preliminary signal, not proven efficacy.\"",

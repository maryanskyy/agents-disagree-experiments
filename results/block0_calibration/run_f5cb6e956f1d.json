We're looking at hospital collapse in five days\u2014maybe six if we're lucky. ARIA can predict patient deterioration seventy-two hours in advance. Seventy-two hours, James. That's three full cycles of intervention before crisis.\n\nJAMES: I understand the math.\n\nSARAH: Do you? Because the math says we can prevent respiratory failure in maybe forty percent of cases if we catch them early enough. That's not theoretical. That's lives. Actual people who won't die if we deploy this.\n\nJAMES: And I'm not disputing that ARIA might save lives in the next week. I'm asking: at what cost to everything that comes after?\n\nSARAH: Everything that comes after assumes there *is* an after. If the hospital system fractures, if we lose staff to burnout and moral injury, if families start refusing treatment because they don't trust us anymore\u2014that's not some distant institutional problem. That's people dying too. Just on a slower timeline.\n\nJAMES: *(leaning back)* You're right. That's fair. But you're also comparing a known harm\u2014deploying an AI system we haven't validated\u2014against a speculative one. We don't actually know what happens when ARIA makes a wrong call at scale.\n\nSARAH: We know what happens if we don't deploy it. I've got the projections. Pediatric ward hits capacity by Thursday. We start triaging. We start choosing who gets a ventilator and who doesn't. Is that the institutional trust you want to protect?\n\nJAMES: That's a false choice and you know it.\n\nSARAH: Is it? Walk me through the alternative.\n\nJAMES: *(pause)* We accelerate the validation protocol. We run ARIA on historical data from the last seventy-two hours, cross-reference against actual outcomes. We identify failure modes. We set hard boundaries on where it can operate\u2014maybe just ICU admissions, maybe just flagging high-risk patients for human review. We do this in forty-eight hours instead of the six months we planned.\n\nSARAH: Forty-eight hours of validation while people are dying in the hallways.\n\nJAMES: Yes.\n\nSARAH: *(quietly)* I can't accept that, James. I genuinely can't. I've been in the ER since yesterday morning. I watched a woman die because we didn't have a bed. She was sixty-three. She had grandchildren. And the thing that would have saved her\u2014the thing that exists, right now, in that computer\u2014we're keeping locked away because we're worried about process.\n\nJAMES: *(meeting her eyes)* I know you watched that. I know you're exhausted and you're grieving and you're angry. And I'm going to tell you something I haven't said out loud yet: I'm terrified I'm wrong. I'm terrified that in six months, we'll look back and realize we could have saved hundreds of people and we didn't because I was too cautious. That keeps me awake. That's real.\n\nSARAH: *(softening slightly)* Okay.\n\nJAMES: But here's what also terrifies me: we deploy ARIA without proper validation, it makes a systematic error\u2014maybe it's biased against certain populations, maybe it's just statistically unlucky\u2014and it kills people. And then, when we try to deploy it in the next crisis, or in other hospitals, nobody trusts it. We've burned the credibility of AI-assisted medicine for years. Maybe a decade. And in that decade, how many people die because we can't use tools that might have helped them?\n\nSARAH: That's... *(pause)* that's actually a real concern.\n\nJAMES: I know you think I'm being naive about institutional trust. But I'm not. I'm being strategic about it. Trust is the only currency we have. Once it's gone, you can't print more.\n\nSARAH: *(leaning forward)* So what if we split the difference? What if we deploy ARIA, but we do it with radical transparency? We publish every decision it makes. We flag every case where it disagrees with human judgment. We create an oversight board that meets daily. We commit to pulling it immediately if we see patterns of error.\n\nJAMES: That's... actually not nothing.\n\nSARAH: And we validate as we go. We don't wait six months. We don't wait forty-eight hours. But we also don't pretend we know more than we do. We treat it like an experiment, because it is one. We're honest about that with patients, with staff, with the public.\n\nJAMES: *(considering)* You'd agree to that? Full transparency, even if it means some people refuse ARIA's recommendations?\n\nSARAH: I'd agree to it. Because you're right about one thing\u2014if we lose institutional trust, we lose the ability to help people in the long run. And I can't live with that either.\n\nJAMES: *(pause)* We'd need to draft the consent language tonight. And we'd need to brief the board before we go live.\n\nSARAH: The board won't approve it.\n\nJAMES: Probably not. But we brief them anyway. We give them the choice to stop us, and we document that they had the choice. That matters.\n\nSARAH: *(nodding slowly)* Okay. Okay, I can work with that.\n\nJAMES: This is still risky, Sarah. You know that, right? We're still making a choice that could go wrong.\n\nSARAH: I know. But at least we're making it together. And we're being honest about what we don't know.\n\nJAMES: *(standing, moving toward the laptop)* Let's start with the consent form. We have maybe four hours before the morning shift.\n\nSARAH: *(following)* Four hours to change everything.\n\nJAMES: *(quietly)* Or to fail more carefully than we would have otherwise.\n\nSARAH: I'll take it.\n\n*They sit.

Here is a detailed design for a tabletop board game, \"Terra Nova: A Climate Futures Game,\" that meets all your specifications.\n\n***\n\n### **Terra Nova: A Climate Futures Game**\n\n**Game Summary:** Players represent global factions working to develop their societies in a world facing climate change. They must collectively keep global warming below a catastrophic tipping point while individually competing to achieve the highest societal well-being. The game forces difficult decisions between short-term economic gain, long-term environmental stability (mitigation), and protecting against unavoidable consequences (adaptation).\n\n---\n\n### **(1) Game Objective**\n\n*   **Cooperative Objective:** Players must work together to prevent the Global Temperature from reaching the final space on the Temperature Track (a 4\u00b0C rise) by the end of the 8th round. If this happens, all players lose.\n*   **Competitive Objective:** If the players successfully prevent catastrophe, the player whose faction has the highest **Well-being Score** at the end of the game is the winner.\n\n---\n\n### **(2) Components List**\n\n*   **1 Main Game Board:** Features:\n    *   A **Round Track** (1-8).\n    *   A **Global Temperature Track** (0\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C in 0.25\u00b0C increments).\n    *   A **CO2 Atmosphere Pool** area.\n    *   A **Tipping Point Track** with 3 threshold zones (e.g., \"Permafrost Melt,\" \"Greenland Ice Sheet,\" \"AMOC Collapse\").\n*   **5 Faction Mats:** One for each player, with tracks for:\n    *   **Resources** (Economic Output)\n    *   **Innovation** (Scientific/Social Progress)\n    *   **CO2 Emissions** (per round)\n    *   **Well-being Score** (Victory Points)\n*   **Cards:**\n    *   **Project Deck (60 cards):** A mix of Mitigation, Adaptation, and Development projects.\n    *   **Event Deck (20 cards):** Random events that affect all players, introducing uncertainty.\n*   **Tokens and Markers:**\n    *   **100 Resource Tokens** (Yellow cubes)\n    *   **100 Innovation Tokens** (Blue cubes)\n    *   **50 CO2 Cubes** (Black cubes)\n    *   **20 Tipping Point Risk Cubes** (Red cubes)\n    *   **5 Faction Markers** (in player colors) to track Well-being.\n    *   **1 Global Temperature Marker** (large red disc).\n    *   **1 Round Marker** (white pawn).\n*   **1 Six-Sided Die (D6)**\n\n---\n\n### **(3) Setup**\n\n1.  Place the main game board in the center of the table.\n2.  Place the Global Temperature Marker on 0\u00b0C and the Round Marker on Round 1.\n3.  Shuffle the Project Deck and the Event Deck and place them face down on their designated spaces.\n4.  Each player chooses a color, takes the corresponding Faction Mat and Faction Marker.\n5.  Each player sets their Faction Mat tracks to the starting values:\n    *   Resources: 5\n    *   Innovation: 2\n    *   CO2 Emissions: 3\n    *   Well-being: 10 (Place their Faction Marker on the 10 space).\n6.  Each player draws 3 cards from the Project Deck.\n\n---\n\n### **(4) Turn Structure**\n\nEach of the 8 rounds is divided into four phases:\n\n1.  **Event Phase:** Draw and resolve the top card of the Event Deck. This might be a natural disaster, a political breakthrough, or a scientific discovery that changes the rules for the round.\n2.  **Generation Phase:** Each player gains Resources and Innovation equal to the current level on their Faction Mat tracks.\n3.  **Action Phase:** Starting with the player who most recently used public transport and proceeding clockwise, players take turns performing one action. This continues until all players have passed consecutively. Actions include:\n    *   **Build a Project:** Pay the Resource/Innovation cost of a Project card from your hand, play it in front of you, and apply its effects.\n    *   **Research:** Pay 3 Innovation to draw 2 new Project cards.\n    *   **Pass:** A player can choose to pass. Once you pass, you cannot take any more actions this round.\n4.  **Consequence Phase:** This phase is resolved in a strict order:\n    *   **A. Emit CO2:** Each player adds CO2 cubes to the CO2 Atmosphere Pool equal to their CO2 Emissions track.\n    *   **B. Increase Temperature:** Move half the CO2 cubes (rounded up) from the Atmosphere Pool to the box above the board. For every 4 cubes in that box, increase the Global Temperature Marker by 0.25\u00b0C. *This represents the delayed effect of emissions.*\n    *   **C. Trigger Feedback Loops:** If the Temperature Marker enters a new zone on the track marked with a \"Feedback\" symbol (e.g., at +1.5\u00b0C), immediately add 3 CO2 cubes to the Atmosphere Pool. *This represents natural systems starting to emit GHGs on their own.*\n    *   **D. Check Tipping Points:** If the Temperature Marker enters a new Tipping Point threshold zone, the active player must add one red Risk Cube to that zone. Then, roll the D6. If the roll is less than or equal to the number of Risk Cubes in that zone, the Tipping Point is triggered. Resolve its (devastating and permanent) effect.\n    *   **E. Suffer Impacts:** For every 1\u00b0C of warming (rounded down), all players lose Well-being points. (e.g., at 1.75\u00b0C, all players lose 1 Well-being. At 2.5\u00b0C, all players lose 2 Well-being). Players with Adaptation projects may be able to ignore some of this loss.\n    *   **F. Advance Round:** Move the Round Marker to the next round.\n\n---\n\n### **(5) Core Mechanics**\n\n*   **Mitigation vs. Adaptation Tradeoff:** Project cards are the core of player choice.\n    *   **Mitigation Projects** (e.g., \"Solar Farm,\" \"Carbon Capture Tech\"): These projects primarily reduce a player's CO2 Emissions track. They are expensive but help the entire table by slowing temperature rise.\n    *   **Adaptation Projects** (e.g., \"Seawall Construction,\" \"Drought-Resistant Crops\"): These projects do not lower emissions. Instead, they protect a player's Well-being score from the \"Suffer Impacts\" phase or negative Event cards. This is a more \"selfish\" path that prioritizes individual scores over solving the root problem.\n    *   **Development Projects**",

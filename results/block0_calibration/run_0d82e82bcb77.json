    "title": "Opening Paragraph for a 2050 Mystery Novel",
    "prompt": "Write the opening paragraph (180-260 words) of a mystery novel set in 2050, where forensic tools are advanced enough to solve most crimes quickly, yet this case resists easy explanation. The paragraph must hook the reader through atmosphere, specificity, and narrative tension while implying deeper social context without worldbuilding dump.\n\nConstraints:\n- First-person perspective.\n- Include one sensory detail tied to weather.\n- Include one object that seems trivial but later could be crucial.\n- End on a line that reframes what the narrator thought they knew.\n\nAfter the paragraph, add three bullet points listing plausible directions for chapter two.\n",

Her mother's gun had been fired exactly once, ballistics confirmed, but the weapon had been locked in a climate-controlled vault downtown, untouched for 180 days according to the access logs. I was holding the backup drive, feeling its weight in my palm like a stone, when the lab director called with the result that made me understand we weren't looking for a killer at all.

Your explanation should focus on phosphorescence (not fluorescence), stay scientifically accurate, and avoid misleading claims.\n\nRequirements:\n- Use at least two different metaphors and briefly compare their strengths/limits.\n- Include one short interactive thought experiment the child can do at home using safe, common objects.\n- Include a \"what scientists still don't fully know\" section in age-appropriate language.\n- End with one question that invites further curiosity.\n\nTone should be encouraging, precise, and imaginative.\n",

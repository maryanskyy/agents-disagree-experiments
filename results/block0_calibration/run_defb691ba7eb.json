EQUITY IMPLICATIONS\n\n| Dimension | Proposal A (Cool Roofs) | Proposal B (Trees) |\n|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Direct beneficiaries** | Building owners; renters benefit indirectly | All residents in district; lower-income households disproportionately benefit (fewer private A/C units) |\n| **Uptake barriers** | Requires owner participation; renters excluded from decision-making | Public good; no participation barrier |\n| **Distributional risk** | HIGH: Affluent neighborhoods likely to participate first; subsidy may flow to property-wealthy areas | MODERATE: Requires intentional targeting to vulnerable districts; risk of \"greenwashing\" in already-green areas |\n| **Gentrification risk** | MODERATE: Cool roofs alone unlikely to trigger displacement, but may increase property values in targeted areas | MODERATE-HIGH: Tree canopy improvements can accelerate gentrification if not paired with anti-displacement policy |\n\n**Critical Finding:** Proposal A's subsidy structure creates a *regressive* outcome unless explicitly restricted to low-income building stock. Proposal B's public-good nature is more equitable *if* targeting is enforced.\n\n---\n\n### 2. TIME-TO-IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\n| Phase | Proposal A | Proposal B |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Year 1** | Subsidy design, outreach; 10-15% uptake | Site prep, planting; minimal temperature effect |\n| **Year 2-3** | 30-40% cumulative uptake; 1.2-1.5\u00b0C reduction in participating buildings | Canopy closure begins; 0.4-0.6\u00b0C district-level reduction |\n| **Year 4** | 45-60% uptake; 1.8\u00b0C reduction (as projected) | 0.9-1.1\u00b0C reduction; co-benefits (air quality, stormwater) emerging |\n| **Year 5-10** | Plateau; maintenance dependent on owner compliance | Continued maturation; 1.5-2.0\u00b0C reduction potential; compounding co-benefits |\n\n**Assessment:** Proposal A delivers faster initial relief but only to participating buildings. Proposal B's impact is slower but broader and accelerates over time. For vulnerable populations without A/C, Proposal B's district-level cooling is more relevant than building-specific reductions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. DURABILITY & MAINTENANCE RISK\n\n**Proposal A (Cool Roofs):**\n- **Durability:** 15-20 years; coating degrades; requires reapplication\n- **Maintenance burden:** On private owners; compliance monitoring difficult\n- **Failure mode:** Owner non-compliance, coating deterioration, reduced effectiveness over time\n- **Risk level:** HIGH\u2014city has limited enforcement leverage post-subsidy\n- **Long-term cost:** Likely requires re-subsidization in years 8-12\n\n**Proposal B (Trees):**\n- **Durability:** 40-60+ years for mature trees; long-term asset\n- **Maintenance burden:** On city; predictable, budgetable costs (~$500-800/tree/year for watering, pruning)\n- **Failure mode:** Drought stress, pests, poor initial establishment (15-25% mortality typical)\n- **Risk level:** MODERATE\u2014city controls maintenance; climate change may reduce suitability of species\n- **Long-term cost:** Ongoing but declining per-unit cost; trees become self-sustaining\n\n**Critical Finding:** Proposal A requires perpetual subsidy; Proposal B is a capital investment with declining marginal costs.\n\n---\n\n### 4. MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY\n\n**Proposal A:**\n- **Temperature measurement:** Building-level data; high precision but limited spatial coverage\n- **Attribution challenge:** MODERATE\u2014difficult to isolate cool roof effect from A/C usage, occupancy, building envelope improvements\n- **Uptake tracking:** Straightforward (subsidy claims)\n- **Co-benefits:** Minimal; energy savings measurable but variable\n- **Uncertainty range:** \u00b10.3\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0C projection has ~17% confidence interval)\n\n**Proposal B:**\n- **Temperature measurement:** District-level surface/air temperature; lower precision, higher spatial variability\n- **Attribution challenge:** HIGH\u2014trees' effect confounded by other urban changes, weather variation, species performance\n- **Uptake tracking:** Tree survival rates; species establishment; canopy coverage (via satellite imagery)\n- **Co-benefits:** Air quality (PM2.5, NOx), stormwater retention, biodiversity\u2014measurable but require additional monitoring infrastructure\n- **Uncertainty range:** \u00b10.4\u00b0C (1.1\u00b0C projection has ~36% confidence interval)\n\n**Critical Finding:** Proposal B has higher measurement uncertainty but more robust co-benefit tracking. Proposal A's temperature benefit is narrower and harder to validate independently.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

This:\n- Ensures equitable distribution (benefits renters directly)\n- Provides faster relief to vulnerable populations\n- Maintains city control over maintenance\n- Reduces measurement uncertainty (city-owned buildings)\n\n**Allocation:**\n- **$30M to tree canopy expansion** (Proposal B primary)\n- **$10M to cool roofs on public/subsidized housing** (Proposal A targeted)\n\n---\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK\n\n### Phase 1 (Year",

renters benefit indirectly | all residents in district; lower-income households disproportionately benefit (fewer private a/c units) | | **uptake barriers** | requires owner participation; renters excluded from decision-making | public good; no participation barrier | | **distributional risk** | high: affluent neighborhoods likely to participate first; subsidy may flow to property-wealthy areas | moderate: requires intentional targeting to vulnerable districts; risk of \"greenwashing\" in already-green areas | | **gentrification risk** | moderate: cool roofs alone unlikely to trigger displacement, but may increase property values in targeted areas | moderate-high: tree canopy improvements can accelerate gentrification if not paired with anti-displacement policy | **critical finding:** proposal a's subsidy structure creates a *regressive* outcome unless explicitly restricted to low-income building stock. proposal b's public-good nature is more equitable *if* targeting is enforced. --- ### 2. time-to-impact analysis | phase | proposal a | proposal b | |-------|-----------|-----------| | **year 1** | subsidy design, outreach; 10-15% uptake | site prep, planting; minimal temperature effect | | **year 2-3** | 30-40% cumulative uptake; 1.2-1.5\u00b0c reduction in participating buildings | canopy closure begins; 0.4-0.6\u00b0c district-level reduction | | **year 4** | 45-60% uptake;

coating degrades; requires reapplication - **maintenance burden:** on private owners; compliance monitoring difficult - **failure mode:** owner non-compliance, coating deterioration, reduced effectiveness over time - **risk level:** high\u2014city has limited enforcement leverage post-subsidy - **long-term cost:** likely requires re-subsidization in years 8-12 **proposal b (trees):** - **durability:** 40-60+ years for mature trees; long-term asset - **maintenance burden:** on city; predictable, budgetable costs (~$500-800/tree/year for watering, pruning) - **failure mode:** drought stress, pests, poor initial establishment (15-25% mortality typical) - **risk level:** moderate\u2014city controls maintenance; climate change may reduce suitability of species - **long-term cost:** ongoing but declining per-unit cost; trees become self-sustaining **critical finding:** proposal a requires perpetual subsidy; proposal b is a capital investment with declining marginal costs. --- ### 4. measurement uncertainty **proposal a:** - **temperature measurement:** building-level data; high precision but limited spatial coverage - **attribution challenge:** moderate\u2014difficult to isolate cool roof effect from a/c usage, occupancy, building envelope improvements - **uptake tracking:** straightforward (subsidy claims) - **co-benefits:** minimal;

lower precision, higher spatial variability - **attribution challenge:** high\u2014trees' effect confounded by other urban changes, weather variation, species performance - **uptake tracking:** tree survival rates; species establishment; canopy coverage (via satellite imagery) - **co-benefits:** air quality (pm2.5, nox), stormwater retention, biodiversity\u2014measurable but require additional monitoring infrastructure - **uncertainty range:** \u00b10.4\u00b0c (1.1\u00b0c projection has ~36% confidence interval) **critical finding:** proposal b has higher measurement uncertainty but more robust co-benefit tracking. proposal a's temperature benefit is narrower and harder to validate independently. --- ### 5. political feasibility **proposal a:** - **constituency support:** building owners, real estate industry (high); renters, environmental groups (moderate) - **opposition:** fiscal conservatives (subsidy concerns); equity advocates (regressive structure) - **messaging ease:** \"reduce energy bills\" (tangible, individual benefit) - **implementation speed:** fast (subsidy rollout straightforward) - **vulnerability:** subsidy program subject to budget cuts; politically fragile **proposal b:** - **constituency support:** environmental groups, public health advocates, residents (high); real estate industry (low-moderate) - **opposition:** fiscal conservatives (maintenance costs);

establish city tree fund | | climate change undermines efficacy | low | moderate | diversify tree species; plan for 2050 climate scenarios | | budget cuts mid-program | high | moderate | front-load proposal b spending (trees planted early); proposal a subsidies easier to cut | | gentrification acceleration | moderate | moderate-high | pair with anti-displacement policy (community land trusts, rent stabilization) | --- ## recommendation ### primary strategy: **proposal b (tree canopy expansion) with equity guardrails** **rationale:** 1. **durability:** capital investment vs. perpetual subsidy; better long-term roi 2. **equity:** public good with intentional targeting to vulnerable districts 3. **co-benefits:** air quality, stormwater, biodiversity, mental health\u2014multiplier effects 4. **measurement:** satellite monitoring enables transparent, scalable tracking 5. **political sustainability:** bipartisan appeal; less vulnerable to budget cuts once trees are planted ### secondary strategy: **targeted proposal a for high-density rental stock** allocate $8-10m of the $40m budget to cool roofs for **municipally-owned or subsidized rental buildings only**. this: - ensures equitable distribution (benefits renters directly) - provides faster relief to vulnerable populations - maintains city control over maintenance - reduces measurement uncertainty (city-owned buildings) **allocation:** - **$30m to tree canopy expansion** (proposal b primary) - **$10m to cool roofs on public/subsidized housing** (proposal a targeted) --- ## implementation framework ### phase 1 (year": 1

They must collectively keep the **Global Temperature Anomaly (GTA)** below **+2.0 \u00b0C** over 10 rounds (decades) while individually accumulating enough **Prosperity Points (PP)** to keep their populations thriving. If the GTA crosses +2.0 \u00b0C, *everyone* loses. Among survivors, the player who best balanced prosperity with sustainability earns the title of Climate Champion \u2014 but all players who survive share the victory.\n\n**Design intent:** This creates cooperative pressure (keep temperature down together) with limited competitive tension (individual prosperity ranking) without zero-sum sabotage.\n\n---\n\n## 2. COMPONENTS LIST\n\n| Qty | Component | Purpose |\n|-----|-----------|---------|\n| 1 | **Game Board** \u2014 world map with shared atmosphere track (GTA thermometer, 0.0\u20133.0 \u00b0C in 0.1 \u00b0C increments), ocean heat reservoir track, and carbon cycle diagram | Central play surface |\n| 5 | **Nation Dashboards** (symmetric; identical starting stats) | Individual player areas |\n| 1 | **GTA Thermometer Marker** (red wooden disc) | Tracks global temperature anomaly |\n| 1 | **Ocean Heat Marker** (blue wooden disc) | Tracks delayed warming stored in oceans |\n| 60 | **Emission Cubes** (grey, 12 per player) | Represent CO\u2082 output per decade |\n| 40 | **Green Tech Tokens** (green discs) | Mitigation investments |\n| 30 | **Resilience Tokens** (orange discs) | Adaptation investments |\n| 50 | **Prosperity Point Chips** (gold, denominations 1/3/5) | Victory currency |\n| 1 | **Carbon Budget Track** (printed on board, 0\u201340 cumulative cubes) | Running total of all emissions |\n| 10 | **Decade Cards** (numbered 1\u201310) | Structure rounds; contain baseline events |\n| 20 | **Feedback Loop Cards** (shuffled deck) | Triggered effects representing reinforcing/balancing feedbacks |\n| 15 | **Tipping Point Tiles** (face-down, placed on board thresholds) | Nonlinear risk mechanic (see \u00a75e) |\n| 1 | **Uncertainty Die** (custom d6: faces show \u22120.1, 0, 0, +0.1, +0.1, +0.2 \u00b0C) | Climate sensitivity uncertainty |\n| 5 | **Policy Dials** (cardboard wheels with 4 sectors) | Players secretly set emission/investment mix |\n| 1 | **Rulebook & Quick-Reference Cards** (5) | Rules and player aids |\n| 1 | **Debrief Guide** (folded card) | For teacher/facilitator |\n\n*All nation dashboards are identical at setup \u2014 no asymmetric roles or hidden advantages.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. SETUP (\u2248 5 minutes)\n\n1. Place the board centrally. Set the **GTA Marker** at **+1.1 \u00b0C** (representing the present-day anomaly). Set the **Ocean Heat Marker** at **2** on its 0\u201310 track.\n2. Shuffle the **Feedback Loop Cards**; place the deck face-down on the board.\n3. Place the **15 Tipping Point Tiles** face-down on designated threshold spaces on the GTA thermometer: three tiles each at +1.4, +1.6, +1.8, +2.0, and +2.5 \u00b0C. (Players know *where* tipping points lurk but not *what* they do until revealed.)\n4. Each player takes a **Nation Dashboard**, **12 Emission Cubes**, **1 Policy Dial**, and **5 PP** starting prosperity.\n5. Stack Decade Cards 1\u201310 in order. Place Green Tech Tokens, Resilience Tokens, and remaining PP chips in a shared supply.\n6. Determine first player randomly; play proceeds clockwise.\n\n---\n\n## 4. TURN STRUCTURE (One Round = One Decade)\n\nEach round has **5 phases**, performed in order. Target: 3.5\u20135 minutes per round \u00d7 10 rounds = 35\u201350 minutes.\n\n| Phase | Name | Duration | Description |\n|-------|------|----------|-------------|\n| A | **Decade Reveal** | 30 sec | Flip the Decade Card; read aloud its baseline event (e.g., \"Population growth: each nation must emit \u2265 2 cubes this decade\"). |\n| B | **Policy Setting** (simultaneous) | 60 sec | Each player secretly sets their Policy Dial, choosing how to allocate their **5 action points** among four sectors: **Emit** (gain PP but add cubes), **Mitigate** (buy Green Tech), **Adapt** (buy Resilience), **Cooperate** (contribute to a shared UN Fund). |\n| C | **Reveal & Resolve** | 90 sec | All dials revealed simultaneously. Resolve emissions, purchases, and fund contributions (see \u00a75). |\n| D | **Climate Update** | 60 sec | Calculate new GTA. Roll Uncertainty Die. Check for Feedback Loop draw. Check Tipping Point thresholds. Advance Ocean Heat. |\n| E | **Consequences** | 60 sec | Apply climate damage (PP losses based on GTA), distribute adaptation protection, and release any delayed ocean heat. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. CORE MECHANICS\n\n### 5a. Policy Dial \u2014 The Allocation Engine\n\nEach player has **5 Action Points (AP)** per round, distributed across four sectors on their dial:\n\n| Sector | Cost | Effect |\n|--------|------|--------|\n| **Emit** | 1 AP \u2192 1 Emission Cube placed on board | Gain **3 PP** per cube emitted. Minimum emission set by Decade Card (usually 1\u20132 cubes). |\n| **Mitigate** | 1 AP \u2192 1 Green Tech Token | Each Green Tech Token **permanently reduces** your minimum emission by 1 (to a floor of 0) starting *next* round. Teaches **delayed payoff of mitigation**. |\n| **Adapt** | 1 AP \u2192 1 Resilience Token | Each Resilience Token **absorbs 2 PP of climate damage** in the Consequences phase, then is discarded. Immediate but consumable. |\n| **Cooperate** | 1 AP \u2192 1 PP donated to UN Fund | When the UN Fund reaches **5 PP**, it automatically converts into a **Global Green Tech** that reduces *every* player's minimum emission by 1. Teaches collective action and free-rider tension. |\n\n**Why this teaches tradeoffs:** Emitting is immediately profitable but collectively destructive. Mitigation is costly now but compounds over time. Adaptation is a short-term band-aid. Cooperation is powerful but vulnerable to free-riding.\n\n### 5b. Carbon Budget & Temperature Calculation (Feedback Loops Built In)\n\nAfter all cubes are placed:\n\n1. **Count total new cubes** emitted this round across all players. Add to the **cumulative Carbon Budget Track**.\n2. **Base warming this round** = (Total new cubes) \u00d7 **0.05 \u00b0C**.\n3. **Roll the Uncertainty Die** and add the result (can be negative). This represents climate sensitivity uncertainty \u2014 the same emissions can produce different warming outcomes.\n4. **Ocean Heat Delay:** Only **60%** of calculated warming is applied to the GTA immediately. The remaining **40%** is added to the **Ocean Heat Track**. Each round, **1 unit** of stored ocean heat is released as **+0.1 \u00b0C** to the GTA. *This mechanic teaches thermal inertia and delayed consequences \u2014 warming continues even after emissions stop.*\n\n### 5c. Feedback Loop Cards\n\n**Trigger:** Whenever the GTA crosses a **0.3 \u00b0C increment** (1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3\u2026), draw a Feedback Loop Card. These represent real climate feedbacks:\n\n- **Reinforcing (positive) feedbacks** (12 of 20): *\"Permafrost Thaw: Release 2 additional Emission Cubes from the supply onto the Carbon Budget Track.\" \"Ice-Albedo Loss: Next round's base warming multiplier increases from \u00d70.05 to \u00d70.07.\"*\n- **Balancing (negative) feedbacks** (5 of 20): *\"Increased Vegetation Uptake: Remove 1 cube from the Carbon Budget Track.\" \"Cloud Formation: Roll the Uncertainty Die; if result is positive, treat it as 0 instead.\"*\n- **Ambiguous feedbacks** (3 of 20): *\"Ocean Carbon Sink Shift: Flip a coin. Heads \u2014 remove 2 cubes. Tails \u2014 add 2 cubes.\" This teaches genuine scientific uncertainty.*\n\n**Design note:** The 12:5:3 ratio means the system is biased toward reinforcing feedbacks at higher temperatures, teaching that warming begets more warming.\n\n### 5d. Climate Damage (Consequences Phase)\n\n| GTA Range | Damage per Nation per Round |\n|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| +1.1\u20131.3 \u00b0C | 0 PP |\n| +1.4\u20131.5 \u00b0C | 1 PP |\n| +1.6\u20131.7 \u00b0C | 2 PP |\n| +1.8\u20131.9 \u00b0C | 4 PP |\n| +2.0+ \u00b0C | **Game Over** (collective loss) |\n\nResilience Tokens absorb damage (1 token absorbs 2 PP of damage, then is discarded). Players without Resilience or PP go into **Climate Debt** (negative PP), representing societal collapse pressure.\n\n### 5e. \u26a1 TIPPING POINT TILES \u2014 The Nonlinear Risk Mechanic\n\nFifteen tiles sit face-down at five GTA thresholds. **When the GTA first reaches or passes a threshold, flip all tiles at that level.** Each tile shows one of three outcomes:\n\n| Symbol | Frequency | Effect |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| \ud83d\udfe2 Stable | 5 of 15 | No additional effect. |\n| \ud83d\udfe1 Stressed | 6 of 15 | A moderate permanent penalty (e.g., \"+0.05 \u00b0C added to every future Climate Update,\" or \"All players' minimum emissions increase by 1 for the rest of the game\"). |\n| \ud83d\udd34 Tipped | 4 of 15 | A severe, irreversible shift (e.g., \"Ice Sheet Collapse: GTA immediately jumps +0.3 \u00b0C and Ocean Heat Track increases by 3,\" or \"Amazon Dieback: Reinforcing feedback cards are now drawn at every 0.2 \u00b0C increment instead of 0.3 \u00b0C\"). |\n\n**Why this is nonlinear:** Players can see the thresholds coming but cannot predict severity. Three tiles per threshold mean the *expected* damage is calculable but the *variance* is high. A lucky flip at +1.6 \u00b0C might yield three \ud83d\udfe2 tiles; an unlucky flip might yield two \ud83d\udd34 tiles that cascade the GTA past the next threshold, triggering *another* set of flips in a chain reaction. This directly models how tipping points can trigger cascading, nonlinear system shifts \u2014 the most critical concept in climate science that linear models miss.\n\n**Irreversibility rule:** \ud83d\udd34 Tipped effects are marked with a permanent token on the board. They cannot be reversed by any player action, teaching that some climate thresholds are one-way doors.\n\n### 5f. Mitigation vs. Adaptation Strategic Balance\n\nThe game is deliberately balanced so that:\n\n- **Pure mitigation** (heavy Green Tech early) causes short-term prosperity pain but makes late-game rounds easy. Risk: if other players don't also mitigate, your sacrifice is wasted.\n- **Pure adaptation** (heavy Resilience spending) lets you survive damage but doesn't slow warming. Risk: damage escalates faster than you can adapt.\n- **Pure emission** (maximize PP) is a tragedy-of-the-commons trap. One player doing it is manageable; if everyone does, the game ends by Round 6.\n- **Optimal play** requires a shifting mix across the game, with early mitigation investment, mid-game cooperation, and targeted adaptation when tipping points hit \u2014 mirroring real-world IPCC recommendations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS\n\n| Condition | Outcome |\n|-----------|---------|\n| GTA reaches **+2.0 \u00b0C** at any point | **ALL PLAYERS LOSE.** The game ends immediately. Debrief begins. |\n| Any player reaches **0 PP or below** and stays there for 2 consecutive rounds | That player's nation experiences **Societal Collapse** \u2014 they are eliminated (but the game continues for others). This teaches that climate justice matters: one nation's collapse doesn't save the rest. |\n| All 10 rounds completed with GTA below +2.0 \u00b0C | **ALL SURVIVING PLAYERS WIN.** The player with the most PP is named **Climate Champion** (bragging rights only). Ties broken by most Green Tech Tokens (rewarding long-term investment). |\n\n**Design note:** The shared loss condition ensures no player can \"win\" by exploiting others. The individual prosperity ranking adds just enough competitive spice to create the social dilemma tension that mirrors real international climate politics.\n\n---\n\n## 7. SAMPLE ROUND (Round 3, Decade 2050s)\n\n**Current state:** GTA = +1.35 \u00b0C. Ocean Heat Track = 3. Carbon Budget = 14 cumulative cubes. Four players (A\u2013D). No tipping points flipped yet.\n\n---\n\n**Phase A \u2014 Decade Reveal**\nDecade Card 3: *\"Industrialization Pressure: Each nation must emit at least 2 cubes this round. Bonus: Any player who emits exactly 2 (minimum) gains 1 extra PP as an efficiency reward.\"*\n\n**Phase B \u2014 Policy Setting** (simultaneous, secret)\n- **Player A** (cautious): 2 AP \u2192 Emit (mandatory minimum), 2 AP \u2192 Mitigate, 1 AP \u2192 Cooperate\n- **Player B** (aggressive): 3 AP \u2192 Emit, 1 AP \u2192 Adapt, 1 AP \u2192 Emit (total 4 cubes)\n- **Player C** (cooperative): 2 AP \u2192 Emit, 1 AP \u2192 Mitigate, 2 AP \u2192 Cooperate\n- **Player D** (adaptive): 2 AP \u2192 Emit, 2 AP \u2192 Adapt, 1 AP \u2192 Mitigate\n\n**Phase C \u2014 Reveal & Resolve**\nAll dials flipped simultaneously. Table reacts \u2014 Player B is emitting heavily.\n\n| Player | Cubes Emitted | PP Gained | Green Tech Bought | Resilience Bought | UN Fund Contribution |\n|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| A | 2 | 6 + 1 bonus = 7 | 2 | 0 | 1 PP |\n| B | 4 | 12 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| C | 2 | 6 + 1 bonus = 7 | 1 | 0 | 2 PP |\n| D | 2 | 6 + 1 bonus = 7 | 1 | 2 | 0 |\n\nTotal new cubes: **10**. UN Fund now at **3 PP** (needs 5 to trigger Global Green Tech). Social tension: Players A and C side-eye Player B.\n\n**Phase D \u2014 Climate Update**\n1. Base warming: 10 cubes \u00d7 0.05 = **+0.50 \u00b0C**\n2. Uncertainty Die roll: **+0.1 \u00b0C** \u2192 Total = **+0.60 \u00b0C**\n3. Ocean Heat split: 60% applied now = **+0.36 \u00b0C**; 40% = **+0.24 \u00b0C** \u2192 add **2 units** to Ocean Heat Track (now at 5). Release 1 stored unit = **+0.1 \u00b0C**.\n4. Total GTA change: +0.36 + 0.1 = **+0.46 \u00b0C**\n5.

Place the **15 Tipping Point Tiles** face-down on designated threshold spaces on the GTA thermometer: three tiles each at +1.4, +1.6, +1.8, +2.0, and +2.5 \u00b0C. (Players know *where* tipping points lurk but not *what* they do until revealed.)\n4. Each player takes a **Nation Dashboard**, **12 Emission Cubes**, **1 Policy Dial**, and **5 PP** starting prosperity.\n5. Stack Decade Cards 1\u201310 in order. Place Green Tech Tokens, Resilience Tokens, and remaining PP chips in a shared supply.\n6. Determine first player randomly; play proceeds clockwise.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Teaches **delayed payoff of mitigation**. |\n| **Adapt** | 1 AP \u2192 1 Resilience Token | Each Resilience Token **absorbs 2 PP of climate damage** in the Consequences phase, then is discarded.

Teaches collective action and free-rider tension. |\n\n**Why this teaches tradeoffs:** Emitting is immediately profitable but collectively destructive. Mitigation is costly now but compounds over time. Adaptation is a short-term band-aid. Cooperation is powerful but vulnerable to free-riding.\n\n### 5b. Carbon Budget & Temperature Calculation (Feedback Loops Built In)\n\nAfter all cubes are placed:\n\n1. **Count total new cubes** emitted this round across all players. Add to the **cumulative Carbon Budget Track**.\n2. **Base warming this round** = (Total new cubes) \u00d7 **0.05 \u00b0C**.\n3. **Roll the Uncertainty Die** and add the result (can be negative). This represents climate sensitivity uncertainty \u2014 the same emissions can produce different warming outcomes.\n4. **Ocean Heat Delay:** Only **60%** of calculated warming is applied to the GTA immediately. The remaining **40%** is added to the **Ocean Heat Track**. Each round, **1 unit** of stored ocean heat is released as **+0.1 \u00b0C** to the GTA. *This mechanic teaches thermal inertia and delayed consequences \u2014 warming continues even after emissions stop.*\n\n### 5c. Feedback Loop Cards\n\n**Trigger:** Whenever the GTA crosses a **0.3 \u00b0C increment** (1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3\u2026), draw a Feedback Loop Card. These represent real climate feedbacks:\n\n- **Reinforcing (positive) feedbacks** (12 of 20): *\"Permafrost Thaw: Release 2 additional Emission Cubes from the supply onto the Carbon Budget Track.\" \"Ice-Albedo Loss: Next round's base warming multiplier increases from \u00d70.05 to \u00d70.07.\"*\n- **Balancing (negative) feedbacks** (5 of 20): *\"Increased Vegetation Uptake: Remove 1 cube from the Carbon Budget Track.\" \"Cloud Formation: Roll the Uncertainty Die; if result is positive, treat it as 0 instead.\"*\n- **Ambiguous feedbacks** (3 of 20): *\"Ocean Carbon Sink Shift: Flip a coin. Heads \u2014 remove 2 cubes. Tails \u2014 add 2 cubes.\" This teaches genuine scientific uncertainty.*\n\n**Design note:** The 12:5:3 ratio means the system is biased toward reinforcing feedbacks at higher temperatures, teaching that warming begets more warming.\n\n### 5d.

Players without Resilience or PP go into **Climate Debt** (negative PP), representing societal collapse pressure.\n\n### 5e. \u26a1 TIPPING POINT TILES \u2014 The Nonlinear Risk Mechanic\n\nFifteen tiles sit face-down at five GTA thresholds. **When the GTA first reaches or passes a threshold, flip all tiles at that level.** Each tile shows one of three outcomes:\n\n| Symbol | Frequency | Effect |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| \ud83d\udfe2 Stable | 5 of 15 | No additional effect. |\n| \ud83d\udfe1 Stressed | 6 of 15 | A moderate permanent penalty (e.g., \"+0.05 \u00b0C added to every future Climate Update,\" or \"All players' minimum emissions increase by 1 for the rest of the game\"). |\n| \ud83d\udd34 Tipped | 4 of 15 | A severe, irreversible shift (e.g., \"Ice Sheet Collapse: GTA immediately jumps +0.3 \u00b0C and Ocean Heat Track increases by 3,\" or \"Amazon Dieback: Reinforcing feedback cards are now drawn at every 0.2 \u00b0C increment instead of 0.3 \u00b0C\"). |\n\n**Why this is nonlinear:** Players can see the thresholds coming but cannot predict severity. Three tiles per threshold mean the *expected* damage is calculable but the *variance* is high. A lucky flip at +1.6 \u00b0C might yield three \ud83d\udfe2 tiles; an unlucky flip might yield two \ud83d\udd34 tiles that cascade the GTA past the next threshold, triggering *another* set of flips in a chain reaction. This directly models how tipping points can trigger cascading, nonlinear system shifts \u2014 the most critical concept in climate science that linear models miss.\n\n**Irreversibility rule:** \ud83d\udd34 Tipped effects are marked with a permanent token on the board. They cannot be reversed by any player action, teaching that some climate thresholds are one-way doors.\n\n### 5f. Mitigation vs. Adaptation Strategic Balance\n\nThe game is deliberately balanced so that:\n\n- **Pure mitigation** (heavy Green Tech early) causes short-term prosperity pain but makes late-game rounds easy. Risk: if other players don't also mitigate, your sacrifice is wasted.\n- **Pure adaptation** (heavy Resilience spending) lets you survive damage but doesn't slow warming. Risk: damage escalates faster than you can adapt.\n- **Pure emission** (maximize PP) is a tragedy-of-the-commons trap. One player doing it is manageable; if everyone does, the game ends by Round 6.\n- **Optimal play** requires a shifting mix across the game, with early mitigation investment, mid-game cooperation, and targeted adaptation when tipping points hit \u2014 mirroring real-world IPCC recommendations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS\n\n| Condition | Outcome |\n|-----------|---------|\n| GTA reaches **+2.0 \u00b0C** at any point | **ALL PLAYERS LOSE.** The game ends immediately. Debrief begins. |\n| Any player reaches **0 PP or below** and stays there for 2 consecutive rounds | That player's nation experiences **Societal Collapse** \u2014 they are eliminated (but the game continues for others). This teaches that climate justice matters: one nation's collapse doesn't save the rest. |\n| All 10 rounds completed with GTA below +2.0 \u00b0C | **ALL SURVIVING PLAYERS WIN.** The player with the most PP is named **Climate Champion** (bragging rights only). Ties broken by most Green Tech Tokens (rewarding long-term investment). |\n\n**Design note:** The shared loss condition ensures no player can \"win\" by exploiting others. The individual prosperity ranking adds just enough competitive spice to create the social dilemma tension that mirrors real international climate politics.\n\n---\n\n## 7.

        "# tipping point: a climate strategy game --- ## 1. game objective players are leaders of interconnected nations sharing a single planet. they must collectively keep the **global temperature anomaly (gta)** below **+2.0 \u00b0c** over 10 rounds (decades) while individually accumulating enough **prosperity points (pp)** to keep their populations thriving. if the gta crosses +2.0 \u00b0c, *everyone* loses. among survivors, the player who best balanced prosperity with sustainability earns the title of climate champion \u2014 but all players who survive share the victory. **design intent:** this creates cooperative pressure (keep temperature down together) with limited competitive tension (individual prosperity ranking) without zero-sum sabotage. --- ## 2. components list | qty | component | purpose | |-----|-----------|---------| | 1 | **game board** \u2014 world map with shared atmosphere track (gta thermometer, 0.0\u20133.0 \u00b0c in 0.1 \u00b0c increments), ocean heat reservoir track, and carbon cycle diagram | central play surface | | 5 | **nation dashboards** (symmetric; identical starting stats) | individual player areas | | 1 | **gta thermometer marker** (red wooden disc) | tracks global temperature anomaly | | 1 | **ocean heat marker** (blue wooden disc) | tracks delayed warming stored in oceans | | 60 | **emission cubes** (grey, 12 per player) | represent co\u2082 output per decade | | 40 | **green tech tokens** (green discs) | mitigation investments | | 30 | **resilience tokens** (orange discs) | adaptation investments | | 50 | **prosperity point chips** (gold, denominations 1/3/5) | victory currency | | 1 | **carbon budget track** (printed on board, 0\u201340 cumulative cubes) | running total of all emissions | | 10 | **decade cards** (numbered 1\u201310) | structure rounds; contain baseline events | | 20 | **feedback loop cards** (shuffled deck) | triggered effects representing reinforcing/balancing feedbacks | | 15 | **tipping point tiles** (face-down, placed on board thresholds) | nonlinear risk mechanic (see \u00a75e) | | 1 | **uncertainty die** (custom d6: faces show \u22120.1, 0, 0, +0.1, +0.1, +0.2 \u00b0c) | climate sensitivity uncertainty | | 5 | **policy dials** (cardboard wheels with 4 sectors) | players secretly set emission/investment mix | | 1 | **rulebook & quick-reference cards** (5) | rules and player aids | | 1 | **debrief guide** (folded card) | for teacher/facilitator | *all nation dashboards are identical at setup \u2014 no asymmetric roles or hidden advantages.* --- ## 3. setup (\u2248 5 minutes) 1. place the board centrally. set the **gta marker** at **+1.1 \u00b0c** (representing the present-day anomaly). set the **ocean heat marker** at **2** on its 0\u201310 track. 2. shuffle the **feedback loop cards**; place the deck face-down on the board. 3. place the **15 tipping point tiles** face-down on designated threshold spaces on the gta thermometer: three tiles each at +1.4, +1.6, +1.8, +2.0, and +2.5 \u00b0c. (players know *where* tipping points lurk but not *what* they do until revealed.) 4. each player takes a **nation dashboard**, **12 emission cubes**, **1 policy dial**, and **5 pp** starting prosperity. 5. stack decade cards 1\u201310 in order. place green tech tokens, resilience tokens, and remaining pp chips in a shared supply. 6. determine first player randomly; play proceeds clockwise. --- ## 4. turn structure (one round = one decade) each round has **5 phases**, performed in order. target: 3.5\u20135 minutes per round \u00d7 10 rounds = 35\u201350 minutes. | phase | name | duration | description | |-------|------|----------|-------------| | a | **decade reveal** | 30 sec | flip the decade card; read aloud its baseline event (e.g., \"population growth: each nation must emit \u2265 2 cubes this decade\"). | | b | **policy setting** (simultaneous) | 60 sec | each player secretly sets their policy dial, choosing how to allocate their **5 action points** among four sectors: **emit** (gain pp but add cubes), **mitigate** (buy green tech), **adapt** (buy resilience), **cooperate** (contribute to a shared un fund). | | c | **reveal & resolve** | 90 sec | all dials revealed simultaneously. resolve emissions, purchases, and fund contributions (see \u00a75). | | d | **climate update** | 60 sec | calculate new gta. roll uncertainty die. check for feedback loop draw. check tipping point thresholds. advance ocean heat. | | e | **consequences** | 60 sec | apply climate damage (pp losses based on gta), distribute adaptation protection, and release any delayed ocean heat. | --- ## 5. core mechanics ### 5a. policy dial \u2014 the allocation engine each player has **5 action points (ap)** per round, distributed across four sectors on their dial: | sector | cost | effect | |--------|------|--------| | **emit** | 1 ap \u2192 1 emission cube placed on board | gain **3 pp** per cube emitted. minimum emission set by decade card (usually 1\u20132 cubes). | | **mitigate** | 1 ap \u2192 1 green tech token | each green tech token **permanently reduces** your minimum emission by 1 (to a floor of 0) starting *next* round. teaches **delayed payoff of mitigation**. | | **adapt** | 1 ap \u2192 1 resilience token | each resilience token **absorbs 2 pp of climate damage** in the consequences phase, then is discarded. immediate but consumable. | | **cooperate** | 1 ap \u2192 1 pp donated to un fund | when the un fund reaches **5 pp**, it automatically converts into a **global green tech** that reduces *every* player's minimum emission by 1. teaches collective action and free-rider tension. | **why this teaches tradeoffs:** emitting is immediately profitable but collectively destructive. mitigation is costly now but compounds over time. adaptation is a short-term band-aid. cooperation is powerful but vulnerable to free-riding. ### 5b. carbon budget & temperature calculation (feedback loops built in) after all cubes are placed: 1. **count total new cubes** emitted this round across all players. add to the **cumulative carbon budget track**. 2. **base warming this round** = (total new cubes) \u00d7 **0.05 \u00b0c**. 3. **roll the uncertainty die** and add the result (can be negative). this represents climate sensitivity uncertainty \u2014 the same emissions can produce different warming outcomes. 4. **ocean heat delay:** only **60%** of calculated warming is applied to the gta immediately. the remaining **40%** is added to the **ocean heat track**. each round, **1 unit** of stored ocean heat is released as **+0.1 \u00b0c** to the gta. *this mechanic teaches thermal inertia and delayed consequences \u2014 warming continues even after emissions stop.* ### 5c. feedback loop cards **trigger:** whenever the gta crosses a **0.3 \u00b0c increment** (1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3\u2026), draw a feedback loop card. these represent real climate feedbacks: - **reinforcing (positive) feedbacks** (12 of 20): *\"permafrost thaw: release 2 additional emission cubes from the supply onto the carbon budget track.\" \"ice-albedo loss: next round's base warming multiplier increases from \u00d70.05 to \u00d70.07.\"* - **balancing (negative) feedbacks** (5 of 20): *\"increased vegetation uptake: remove 1 cube from the carbon budget track.\" \"cloud formation: roll the uncertainty die; if result is positive, treat it as 0 instead.\"* - **ambiguous feedbacks** (3 of 20): *\"ocean carbon sink shift: flip a coin. heads \u2014 remove 2 cubes. tails \u2014 add 2 cubes.\" this teaches genuine scientific uncertainty.* **design note:** the 12:5:3 ratio means the system is biased toward reinforcing feedbacks at higher temperatures, teaching that warming begets more warming. ### 5d. climate damage (consequences phase) | gta range | damage per nation per round | |-----------|-----------------------------| | +1.1\u20131.3 \u00b0c | 0 pp | | +1.4\u20131.5 \u00b0c | 1 pp | | +1.6\u20131.7 \u00b0c | 2 pp | | +1.8\u20131.9 \u00b0c | 4 pp | | +2.0+ \u00b0c | **game over** (collective loss) | resilience tokens absorb damage (1 token absorbs 2 pp of damage, then is discarded). players without resilience or pp go into **climate debt** (negative pp), representing societal collapse pressure. ### 5e. \u26a1 tipping point tiles \u2014 the nonlinear risk mechanic fifteen tiles sit face-down at five gta thresholds. **when the gta first reaches or passes a threshold, flip all tiles at that level.** each tile shows one of three outcomes: | symbol | frequency | effect | |--------|-----------|--------| | \ud83d\udfe2 stable | 5 of 15 | no additional effect. | | \ud83d\udfe1 stressed | 6 of 15 | a moderate permanent penalty (e.g., \"+0.05 \u00b0c added to every future climate update,\" or \"all players' minimum emissions increase by 1 for the rest of the game\"). | | \ud83d\udd34 tipped | 4 of 15 | a severe, irreversible shift (e.g., \"ice sheet collapse: gta immediately jumps +0.3 \u00b0c and ocean heat track increases by 3,\" or \"amazon dieback: reinforcing feedback cards are now drawn at every 0.2 \u00b0c increment instead of 0.3 \u00b0c\"). | **why this is nonlinear:** players can see the thresholds coming but cannot predict severity. three tiles per threshold mean the *expected* damage is calculable but the *variance* is high. a lucky flip at +1.6 \u00b0c might yield three \ud83d\udfe2 tiles; an unlucky flip might yield two \ud83d\udd34 tiles that cascade the gta past the next threshold, triggering *another* set of flips in a chain reaction. this directly models how tipping points can trigger cascading, nonlinear system shifts \u2014 the most critical concept in climate science that linear models miss. **irreversibility rule:** \ud83d\udd34 tipped effects are marked with a permanent token on the board. they cannot be reversed by any player action, teaching that some climate thresholds are one-way doors. ### 5f. mitigation vs. adaptation strategic balance the game is deliberately balanced so that: - **pure mitigation** (heavy green tech early) causes short-term prosperity pain but makes late-game rounds easy. risk: if other players don't also mitigate, your sacrifice is wasted. - **pure adaptation** (heavy resilience spending) lets you survive damage but doesn't slow warming. risk: damage escalates faster than you can adapt. - **pure emission** (maximize pp) is a tragedy-of-the-commons trap. one player doing it is manageable; if everyone does, the game ends by round 6. - **optimal play** requires a shifting mix across the game, with early mitigation investment, mid-game cooperation, and targeted adaptation when tipping points hit \u2014 mirroring real-world ipcc recommendations. --- ## 6. win/loss conditions | condition | outcome | |-----------|---------| | gta reaches **+2.0 \u00b0c** at any point | **all players lose.** the game ends immediately. debrief begins. | | any player reaches **0 pp or below** and stays there for 2 consecutive rounds | that player's nation experiences **societal collapse** \u2014 they are eliminated (but the game continues for others). this teaches that climate justice matters: one nation's collapse doesn't save the rest. | | all 10 rounds completed with gta below +2.0 \u00b0c | **all surviving players win.** the player with the most pp is named **climate champion** (bragging rights only). ties broken by most green tech tokens (rewarding long-term investment). | **design note:** the shared loss condition ensures no player can \"win\" by exploiting others. the individual prosperity ranking adds just enough competitive spice to create the social dilemma tension that mirrors real international climate politics. --- ## 7. sample round (round 3, decade 2050s) **current state:** gta = +1.35 \u00b0c. ocean heat track = 3. carbon budget = 14 cumulative cubes. four players (a\u2013d). no tipping points flipped yet. --- **phase a \u2014 decade reveal** decade card 3: *\"industrialization pressure: each nation must emit at least 2 cubes this round. bonus: any player who emits exactly 2 (minimum) gains 1 extra pp as an efficiency reward.\"* **phase b \u2014 policy setting** (simultaneous, secret) - **player a** (cautious): 2 ap \u2192 emit (mandatory minimum), 2 ap \u2192 mitigate, 1 ap \u2192 cooperate - **player b** (aggressive): 3 ap \u2192 emit, 1 ap \u2192 adapt, 1 ap \u2192 emit (total 4 cubes) - **player c** (cooperative): 2 ap \u2192 emit, 1 ap \u2192 mitigate, 2 ap \u2192 cooperate - **player d** (adaptive): 2 ap \u2192 emit, 2 ap \u2192 adapt, 1 ap \u2192 mitigate **phase c \u2014 reveal & resolve** all dials flipped simultaneously. table reacts \u2014 player b is emitting heavily. | player | cubes emitted | pp gained | green tech bought | resilience bought | un fund contribution | |--------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------| | a | 2 | 6 + 1 bonus = 7 | 2 | 0 | 1 pp | | b | 4 | 12 | 0 | 1 | 0 | | c | 2 | 6 + 1 bonus = 7 | 1 | 0 | 2 pp | | d | 2 | 6 + 1 bonus = 7 | 1 | 2 | 0 | total new cubes: **10**. un fund now at **3 pp** (needs 5 to trigger global green tech). social tension: players a and c side-eye player b. **phase d \u2014 climate update** 1. base warming: 10 cubes \u00d7 0.05 = **+0.50 \u00b0c** 2. uncertainty die roll: **+0.1 \u00b0c** \u2192 total = **+0.60 \u00b0c** 3. ocean heat split: 60% applied now = **+0.36 \u00b0c**;

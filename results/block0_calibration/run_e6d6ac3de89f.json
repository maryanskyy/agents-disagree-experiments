    "title": "Opening Paragraph for a 2050 Mystery Novel",
    "prompt": "Write the opening paragraph (180-260 words) of a mystery novel set in 2050, where forensic tools are advanced enough to solve most crimes quickly, yet this case resists easy explanation. The paragraph must hook the reader through atmosphere, specificity, and narrative tension while implying deeper social context without worldbuilding dump.\n\nConstraints:\n- First-person perspective.\n- Include one sensory detail tied to weather.\n- Include one object that seems trivial but later could be crucial.\n- End on a line that reframes what the narrator thought they knew.\n\nAfter the paragraph, add three bullet points listing plausible directions for chapter two.\n",

Our advanced forensic scanners, typically capable of reconstructing a crime from a single epidermal cell in under an hour, were spitting out an anomaly: \"Insufficient Data \u2013 Unidentified Interference.\" It was a phrase I hadn't seen since my academy days, back when the 'golden age of forensics' was still a distant dream. Detective Anya Sharma, her face a mask of professional frustration, gestured to a small, intricately carved wooden bird clutched in the victim's hand. \"No prints, no DNA, no traceable origin. Just\u2026 this.\" My comm-link buzzed, displaying a priority alert from Central Command. The victim, a prominent bio-engineer, had been working on something classified. Something that, according to the encrypted message now scrolling across my screen, was supposed to be impossible to steal.

A red digital clock above the screen counted down to the next emergency briefing.\n\n**A:** You\u2019re late.\n\n**B:** I was in Legal. They\u2019re not thrilled you called it \u201ca moral math problem\u201d in the last meeting.\n\n**A:** It is a moral math problem. Ten thousand ventilators short. ICU triage in parking garages. If we have a tool that can reduce mortality\u2014by even a few percentage points\u2014sitting on it is not neutrality. It\u2019s a choice.\n\n**B:** I\u2019m not advocating neutrality. I\u2019m advocating legitimacy. If we deploy a powerful model that can recommend treatments and allocate scarce resources without a clear, reviewable process, and it harms people\u2014especially people who already mistrust the system\u2014we don\u2019t just lose this tool. We lose the institution.\n\n**A:** Legitimacy doesn\u2019t intubate patients.\n\n**B:** Trust does. Not today, maybe not even this week. But trust is what gets people to seek care early, to take vaccines, to believe guidance. You burn that down, and your utilitarian spreadsheet will look very different next month.\n\n**A:** Don\u2019t make it sound like I\u2019m trying to set fires. We built this to help.\n\n**B:** You built it to help under constraints. There\u2019s a difference.\n\n**A:** Look, the model has been validated on three hospital systems. It predicts deterioration twelve hours earlier than our standard scoring. It proposes drug combos that flag interactions we miss. Doctors are already rationing time with a coin-flip behind the curtain. This is at least systematic.\n\n**B:** Systematic isn\u2019t the same as just. If it\u2019s trained on data from those systems, it bakes in their patterns: who got tested, who got admitted, who was turned away. It will reproduce that, but with a veneer of \u201cAI said so.\u201d That\u2019s a special kind of harm.\n\n**A:** We can audit for bias.\n\n**B:** You can, and you should. But not in forty-eight hours. Not at the scale you want. \u201cAudit\u201d is not a magic incantation you throw at a model to make it ethical.\n\n**A:** And \u201cprocedure\u201d isn\u2019t a magic incantation that makes people live.\n\n**B:** It\u2019s not. It\u2019s the difference between a hard decision and an arbitrary one.\n\n**A:** Fine. Here\u2019s hard: people will die waiting for your perfect rollout. We\u2019re already improvising with less evidence than this model. Doctors are using Twitter threads and preprints to decide care. This tool at least aggregates what we know and updates in near real time.\n\n**B:** It also updates in near real time on potentially contaminated signals. You told me yourself it can adapt based on outcomes. If the outcomes reflect our rushed deployment, the model learns from its own mistakes\u2014and amplifies them.\n\n**A:** That\u2019s why we monitor.\n\n**B:** Monitor with what staff? The analytics team is sick. The ethics board hasn\u2019t met in two weeks. And the communities most affected have no seat at the table right now. That\u2019s not a small omission. It\u2019s the point.\n\n**A:** The point right now is there are patients in hallways. I toured the east wing. There\u2019s a resident making triage calls with a marker on her glove because her clipboard was taken for another ward. When I say \u201crelease the tool,\u201d I\u2019m not thinking about a press launch. I\u2019m thinking about that glove.\n\n**B:** And I\u2019m thinking about the aftermath. About the family who hears their mother was denied a bed because an algorithm predicted \u201clow benefit.\u201d About a headline: *Hospital Uses Secret AI to Decide Who Lives.* You think that doesn\u2019t matter because you can show a ROC curve? It matters because it\u2019s plausible.\n\n**A:** We don\u2019t have to be secretive.\n\n**B:** We haven\u2019t been transparent. We can\u2019t even explain the model to our own clinicians without a slide deck that looks like a magic show.\n\n**A:** Explanations can be generated. We can constrain it to recommendations with cited evidence.\n\n**B:** Cited evidence from what? Preprints? Retractions? The model doesn\u2019t know which journals are predatory. It doesn\u2019t know which studies were performed on populations that match ours. We do. Or we\u2019re supposed to.\n\n**A:** You\u2019re painting it like a demon in a box. It\u2019s a tool. It\u2019s risky, yes. So is every ventilator setting. So is every drug given off-label because there\u2019s no time for trials. We accept risk when the alternative is guaranteed harm.\n\n**B:** Accept risk with consent, with oversight, with accountability. That\u2019s the difference. A ventilator is a known device with known failure modes. This is an adaptive system making suggestions that humans will defer to because they\u2019re exhausted.\n\n**A:** We can require human sign-off.\n\n**B:** In practice, \u201chuman in the loop\u201d becomes \u201chuman rubber stamp.\u201d Especially at three a.m. after a double shift.\n\n**A:** Then you\u2019re arguing we can\u2019t use any decision support in a crisis.\n\n**B:** I\u2019m arguing we can\u2019t pretend deployment is just flipping a switch. We need guardrails that are real, not aspirational.\n\n**A:** What would satisfy you? Say it. Not \u201cprocedural justice\u201d like it\u2019s a hymn. Concrete.\n\n**B:** A protocol approved by an emergency ethics committee\u2014yes, even if that committee is formed today. A public-facing description of what the tool does and does not do. A mechanism for clinicians to override without penalty. And an equity assessment with community input, even if it\u2019s a rapid consult.\n\n**A:** That\u2019s four new processes.\n\n**B:** It\u2019s four commitments. Two can be done in hours. Two in days.\n\n**A:** Days we don\u2019t have.\n\n**B:** You keep saying that. But we are also not powerless. There are ways to deploy partially. There are ways to use it where it\u2019s safer.\n\n**A:** Safer means less impact.\n\n**B:** Safer means less catastrophic impact. There\u2019s a difference.\n\n**A:** Here\u2019s my vulnerable admission, since we\u2019re trading hymns: I\u2019m scared of being the person who had something that could have helped and didn\u2019t use it. I don\u2019t want to look at the numbers afterward and see a gap we could have closed.\n\n**B:** I appreciate that. Here\u2019s mine: I\u2019m scared of being the person who clung to procedure while people died. I know what that looks like, too. My father waited in a clinic during the last outbreak because the system was \u201cverifying eligibility.\u201d He didn\u2019t die, but he never trusted the hospital again. I still feel that in my body.\n\n**A:** So we\u2019re both haunted. Great.\n\n**B:** Haunted can be useful. It keeps you from being reckless.\n\n**A:** Or from being effective.\n\nA\u2019s hand hovered over the laptop, then dropped, fingers drumming a staccato that tried to sound like decisiveness and came out like anxiety.\n\n**A:** If we don\u2019t deploy it broadly, what\u2019s your alternative? Because \u201cdo nothing\u201d is not an alternative.\n\n**B:** I\u2019m not offering \u201cdo nothing.\u201d I\u2019m offering \u201cdo less, better.\u201d Use the model first as an early warning system only\u2014no treatment recommendations, no allocation suggestions. It flags deteriorations, it highlights lab patterns. Clinicians decide. That reduces the risk of it becoming the moral authority.\n\n**A:** That would still save lives, but not as many. The treatment recommendation module is where the real gains are.\n\n**B:** And where the real harms are. Start with the piece that\u2019s easiest to validate. And make the more contentious module opt-in per department with explicit training.\n\n**A:** Opt-in slows adoption.\n\n**B:** Opt-in builds consent. It creates a record that people knew what they were using. That matters when things go wrong\u2014which they will.\n\n**A:** You\u2019re assuming they will.\n\n**B:** I\u2019m assuming reality. Everything fails under stress.\n\nA glanced at the clock. The red digits were indifferent.\n\n**A:** Turning point, then. I can concede staged deployment. Early warning first. But I need a timeline. Not \u201csometime when trust is rebuilt.\u201d We need treatment suggestions online within, say, seventy-two hours.\n\n**B:** Seventy-two is aggressive. But\u2014turning point from me\u2014I can concede we shouldn\u2019t wait for a full traditional review. This is an emergency. We can convene an emergency ethics committee today: one clinician from ICU, one nurse, one data scientist not on your team, one community representative, one patient advocate. They approve a limited protocol tonight.\n\n**A:** Community representative tonight? We don\u2019t have a list.\n\n**B:** We do. The hospital advisory council. They\u2019ve been asking to be included for years. Call them. That\u2019s actually part of rebuilding trust: not when it\u2019s convenient, but when it\u2019s hard.\n\n**A:** I\u2019ll call. But if they say no\u2014\n\n**B:** Then we document that we tried, and we proceed with the advocate. The attempt matters. The record matters.\n\n**A:** You really think a record matters to someone losing a parent?\n\n**B:** I think it matters to the next someone. And to the first someone, too, even if it doesn\u2019t comfort them. People can accept tragedy. What they don\u2019t accept is being treated like an afterthought.\n\nA sat back, the drumming stopped.\n\n**A:** Here\u2019s my second argument, then. It\u2019s not just about aggregate lives. It\u2019s about fairness in a different way. Right now, care varies by clinician, by shift, by who\u2019s loudest. A model can standardize minimum quality across wards. That\u2019s procedural justice of a sort.\n\n**B:** Standardization can be justice if the standard is fair. If it\u2019s biased, it standardizes injustice. My second argument: institutions survive by being seen as accountable. If the tool is involved, accountability gets blurry fast. \u201cThe model said.\u201d \u201cThe vendor said.\u201d \u201cThe data said.\u201d We need lines of responsibility drawn in ink.\n\n**A:** Responsibility stays with the clinician.\n\n**B:** Then you need to protect clinicians from being coerced by the model or by administration. Otherwise \u201cresponsibility\u201d is just liability dumped downward.\n\n**A:** You\u2019re right. We can write a policy: AI recommendations are advisory; no clinician will be disciplined for overriding; overrides are logged for learning, not punishment.\n\n**B:** And the logs are reviewed by an oversight team that includes someone outside your group.\n\n**A:** Fine. External review. But if external review becomes a veto\u2014\n\n**B:** It\u2019s not a veto. It\u2019s a safeguard. You can design it so it\u2019s a stopgap only if certain thresholds trip: unexpected mortality spikes, disparity metrics, high override rates.\n\n**A:** Disparity metrics in real time?\n\n**B:** Crude ones. Admission rates by zip code. Deterioration alerts by race if recorded. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s better than blindness.\n\nA opened a document, then hesitated.\n\n**A:** The press. We need to get ahead of it.\n\n**B:** We need to be honest with it. A statement: we\u2019re deploying an AI early warning system under emergency protocol, with human oversight, with an independent ethics committee, with community consultation, and we will publish performance and disparity data weekly.\n\n**A:** Publish weekly. That\u2019s\u2026 braver than I planned.\n\n**B:** It\u2019s also how you avoid the \u201csecret AI\u201d headline.\n\nA exhaled, sharp.\n\n**A:** Provisional agreement: tonight, emergency committee and public protocol. Tomorrow morning, early warning module in ICU and step-down. Treatment recommendations remain off by default. In seventy-two hours, committee reviews updated validation and equity checks; if thresholds are met, treatment module can be enabled as opt-in with training.\n\n**B:** Add one more clause: if thresholds are not met, we don\u2019t just \u201creassess later.\u201d We pause, we say publicly why, and we don\u2019t quietly keep using it.\n\n**A:** That\u2019s the fragility, isn\u2019t it? Saying out loud that we might stop.\n\n**B:** That\u2019s credibility.\n\n**A:** I can live with it. I don\u2019t love it. But I can live with it.\n\n**B:** I don\u2019t love it either. But I can stand in front of it.\n\nThe red clock ticked on. A slid the laptop across the table.\n\n**A:** Draft the committee charter. I\u2019ll call the advisory council and ICU. If this collapses, it collapses fast.\n\n**B:** Then we hold it up together. Not with slogans. With work.\n\nA nodded once\u2014more like a truce than an embrace.\n\n**A:** Seventy-two hours.\n\n**B:** Seventy-two hours. And a paper trail strong enough to deserve whatever happens next.",

We can write a policy: AI recommendations are advisory; no clinician will be disciplined for overriding; overrides are logged for learning, not punishment.\n\n**B:** And the logs are reviewed by an oversight team that includes someone outside your group.\n\n**A:** Fine.

        "the conference room\u2019s glass wall rattled faintly whenever the ventilation system kicked into a higher gear. a red digital clock above the screen counted down to the next emergency briefing. **a:** you\u2019re late. **b:** i was in legal. they\u2019re not thrilled you called it \u201ca moral math problem\u201d in the last meeting. **a:** it is a moral math problem. ten thousand ventilators short. icu triage in parking garages. if we have a tool that can reduce mortality\u2014by even a few percentage points\u2014sitting on it is not neutrality. it\u2019s a choice. **b:** i\u2019m not advocating neutrality. i\u2019m advocating legitimacy. if we deploy a powerful model that can recommend treatments and allocate scarce resources without a clear, reviewable process, and it harms people\u2014especially people who already mistrust the system\u2014we don\u2019t just lose this tool. we lose the institution. **a:** legitimacy doesn\u2019t intubate patients. **b:** trust does. not today, maybe not even this week. but trust is what gets people to seek care early, to take vaccines, to believe guidance. you burn that down, and your utilitarian spreadsheet will look very different next month. **a:** don\u2019t make it sound like i\u2019m trying to set fires. we built this to help. **b:** you built it to help under constraints. there\u2019s a difference. **a:** look, the model has been validated on three hospital systems. it predicts deterioration twelve hours earlier than our standard scoring. it proposes drug combos that flag interactions we miss. doctors are already rationing time with a coin-flip behind the curtain. this is at least systematic. **b:** systematic isn\u2019t the same as just. if it\u2019s trained on data from those systems, it bakes in their patterns: who got tested, who got admitted, who was turned away. it will reproduce that, but with a veneer of \u201cai said so.\u201d that\u2019s a special kind of harm. **a:** we can audit for bias. **b:** you can, and you should. but not in forty-eight hours. not at the scale you want. \u201caudit\u201d is not a magic incantation you throw at a model to make it ethical. **a:** and \u201cprocedure\u201d isn\u2019t a magic incantation that makes people live. **b:** it\u2019s not. it\u2019s the difference between a hard decision and an arbitrary one. **a:** fine. here\u2019s hard: people will die waiting for your perfect rollout. we\u2019re already improvising with less evidence than this model. doctors are using twitter threads and preprints to decide care. this tool at least aggregates what we know and updates in near real time. **b:** it also updates in near real time on potentially contaminated signals. you told me yourself it can adapt based on outcomes. if the outcomes reflect our rushed deployment, the model learns from its own mistakes\u2014and amplifies them. **a:** that\u2019s why we monitor. **b:** monitor with what staff? the analytics team is sick. the ethics board hasn\u2019t met in two weeks. and the communities most affected have no seat at the table right now. that\u2019s not a small omission. it\u2019s the point. **a:** the point right now is there are patients in hallways. i toured the east wing. there\u2019s a resident making triage calls with a marker on her glove because her clipboard was taken for another ward. when i say \u201crelease the tool,\u201d i\u2019m not thinking about a press launch. i\u2019m thinking about that glove. **b:** and i\u2019m thinking about the aftermath. about the family who hears their mother was denied a bed because an algorithm predicted \u201clow benefit.\u201d about a headline: *hospital uses secret ai to decide who lives.* you think that doesn\u2019t matter because you can show a roc curve? it matters because it\u2019s plausible. **a:** we don\u2019t have to be secretive. **b:** we haven\u2019t been transparent. we can\u2019t even explain the model to our own clinicians without a slide deck that looks like a magic show. **a:** explanations can be generated. we can constrain it to recommendations with cited evidence. **b:** cited evidence from what? preprints? retractions? the model doesn\u2019t know which journals are predatory. it doesn\u2019t know which studies were performed on populations that match ours. we do. or we\u2019re supposed to. **a:** you\u2019re painting it like a demon in a box. it\u2019s a tool. it\u2019s risky, yes. so is every ventilator setting. so is every drug given off-label because there\u2019s no time for trials. we accept risk when the alternative is guaranteed harm. **b:** accept risk with consent, with oversight, with accountability. that\u2019s the difference. a ventilator is a known device with known failure modes. this is an adaptive system making suggestions that humans will defer to because they\u2019re exhausted. **a:** we can require human sign-off. **b:** in practice, \u201chuman in the loop\u201d becomes \u201chuman rubber stamp.\u201d especially at three a.m. after a double shift. **a:** then you\u2019re arguing we can\u2019t use any decision support in a crisis. **b:** i\u2019m arguing we can\u2019t pretend deployment is just flipping a switch. we need guardrails that are real, not aspirational. **a:** what would satisfy you? say it. not \u201cprocedural justice\u201d like it\u2019s a hymn. concrete. **b:** a protocol approved by an emergency ethics committee\u2014yes, even if that committee is formed today. a public-facing description of what the tool does and does not do. a mechanism for clinicians to override without penalty. and an equity assessment with community input, even if it\u2019s a rapid consult. **a:** that\u2019s four new processes. **b:** it\u2019s four commitments. two can be done in hours. two in days. **a:** days we don\u2019t have. **b:** you keep saying that. but we are also not powerless. there are ways to deploy partially. there are ways to use it where it\u2019s safer. **a:** safer means less impact. **b:** safer means less catastrophic impact. there\u2019s a difference. **a:** here\u2019s my vulnerable admission, since we\u2019re trading hymns: i\u2019m scared of being the person who had something that could have helped and didn\u2019t use it. i don\u2019t want to look at the numbers afterward and see a gap we could have closed. **b:** i appreciate that. here\u2019s mine: i\u2019m scared of being the person who clung to procedure while people died. i know what that looks like, too. my father waited in a clinic during the last outbreak because the system was \u201cverifying eligibility.\u201d he didn\u2019t die, but he never trusted the hospital again. i still feel that in my body. **a:** so we\u2019re both haunted. great. **b:** haunted can be useful. it keeps you from being reckless. **a:** or from being effective. a\u2019s hand hovered over the laptop, then dropped, fingers drumming a staccato that tried to sound like decisiveness and came out like anxiety. **a:** if we don\u2019t deploy it broadly, what\u2019s your alternative? because \u201cdo nothing\u201d is not an alternative. **b:** i\u2019m not offering \u201cdo nothing.\u201d i\u2019m offering \u201cdo less, better.\u201d use the model first as an early warning system only\u2014no treatment recommendations, no allocation suggestions. it flags deteriorations, it highlights lab patterns. clinicians decide. that reduces the risk of it becoming the moral authority. **a:** that would still save lives, but not as many. the treatment recommendation module is where the real gains are. **b:** and where the real harms are. start with the piece that\u2019s easiest to validate. and make the more contentious module opt-in per department with explicit training. **a:** opt-in slows adoption. **b:** opt-in builds consent. it creates a record that people knew what they were using. that matters when things go wrong\u2014which they will. **a:** you\u2019re assuming they will. **b:** i\u2019m assuming reality. everything fails under stress. a glanced at the clock. the red digits were indifferent. **a:** turning point, then. i can concede staged deployment. early warning first. but i need a timeline. not \u201csometime when trust is rebuilt.\u201d we need treatment suggestions online within, say, seventy-two hours. **b:** seventy-two is aggressive. but\u2014turning point from me\u2014i can concede we shouldn\u2019t wait for a full traditional review. this is an emergency. we can convene an emergency ethics committee today: one clinician from icu, one nurse, one data scientist not on your team, one community representative, one patient advocate. they approve a limited protocol tonight. **a:** community representative tonight? we don\u2019t have a list. **b:** we do. the hospital advisory council. they\u2019ve been asking to be included for years. call them. that\u2019s actually part of rebuilding trust: not when it\u2019s convenient, but when it\u2019s hard. **a:** i\u2019ll call. but if they say no\u2014 **b:** then we document that we tried, and we proceed with the advocate. the attempt matters. the record matters. **a:** you really think a record matters to someone losing a parent? **b:** i think it matters to the next someone. and to the first someone, too, even if it doesn\u2019t comfort them. people can accept tragedy. what they don\u2019t accept is being treated like an afterthought. a sat back, the drumming stopped. **a:** here\u2019s my second argument, then. it\u2019s not just about aggregate lives. it\u2019s about fairness in a different way. right now, care varies by clinician, by shift, by who\u2019s loudest. a model can standardize minimum quality across wards. that\u2019s procedural justice of a sort. **b:** standardization can be justice if the standard is fair. if it\u2019s biased, it standardizes injustice. my second argument: institutions survive by being seen as accountable. if the tool is involved, accountability gets blurry fast. \u201cthe model said.\u201d \u201cthe vendor said.\u201d \u201cthe data said.\u201d we need lines of responsibility drawn in ink. **a:** responsibility stays with the clinician. **b:** then you need to protect clinicians from being coerced by the model or by administration. otherwise \u201cresponsibility\u201d is just liability dumped downward. **a:** you\u2019re right. we can write a policy: ai recommendations are advisory; no clinician will be disciplined for overriding; overrides are logged for learning, not punishment. **b:** and the logs are reviewed by an oversight team that includes someone outside your group. **a:** fine. external review. but if external review becomes a veto\u2014 **b:** it\u2019s not a veto. it\u2019s a safeguard. you can design it so it\u2019s a stopgap only if certain thresholds trip: unexpected mortality spikes, disparity metrics, high override rates. **a:** disparity metrics in real time? **b:** crude ones. admission rates by zip code. deterioration alerts by race if recorded. it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s better than blindness. a opened a document, then hesitated. **a:** the press. we need to get ahead of it. **b:** we need to be honest with it. a statement: we\u2019re deploying an ai early warning system under emergency protocol, with human oversight, with an independent ethics committee, with community consultation, and we will publish performance and disparity data weekly. **a:** publish weekly. that\u2019s\u2026 braver than i planned. **b:** it\u2019s also how you avoid the \u201csecret ai\u201d headline. a exhaled, sharp. **a:** provisional agreement: tonight, emergency committee and public protocol. tomorrow morning, early warning module in icu and step-down. treatment recommendations remain off by default. in seventy-two hours, committee reviews updated validation and equity checks; if thresholds are met, treatment module can be enabled as opt-in with training. **b:** add one more clause: if thresholds are not met, we don\u2019t just \u201creassess later.\u201d we pause, we say publicly why, and we don\u2019t quietly keep using it. **a:** that\u2019s the fragility, isn\u2019t it?

        "the game you've requested, \"terra nova,\" is designed to engage players aged 12 and up in the complexities of climate science through strategic decision-making and interactive gameplay. it focuses on key climate concepts without resorting to didactic lectures. ## terra nova: a climate crossroads game **game objective:** to collectively guide humanity towards a sustainable future by balancing economic prosperity with ecological health, ultimately aiming to keep global temperature rise below critical thresholds. while the primary goal is collective survival, players also compete for individual \"legacy points\" by contributing effectively to the planet's well-being. --- ### (1) game objective the primary objective is for all players to collectively prevent the global temperature from exceeding **+2.0\u00b0c** above pre-industrial levels by the end of the game (representing the year 2100). if the temperature exceeds this, all players lose. a secondary, individual objective is to accumulate the most **legacy points** by the end of the game. legacy points are awarded for successful mitigation efforts, effective adaptation, and contributing to global stability. --- ### (2) components list * **game board:** * **global temperature track:** 0.0\u00b0c to +4.0\u00b0c, with markers for +1.5\u00b0c and +2.0\u00b0c. * **resource tracks:** * **global economy (ge):** 0 to 20 (represents global gdp/prosperity). * **planetary health (ph):** 0 to 20 (represents ecosystem health/biodiversity). * **region spaces (5):** each with 3 action slots. (e.g., north america, europe, asia, africa, oceania/south america). * **feedback loop track:** a circular track with 5-7 spaces, each representing a climate feedback loop (e.g., arctic ice melt, permafrost thaw, ocean acidification, forest dieback). * **tipping point zone:** a designated area on the feedback loop track. * **tokens:** * **global temperature marker (1):** to track temperature. * **global economy marker (1):** to track ge. * **planetary health marker (1):** to track ph. * **feedback loop markers (5-7):** one for each feedback loop. * **player pawns (3-5):** one per player. * **action cubes (15-25):** 5 per player, in their player color. * **legacy point tokens:** various denominations (1s, 5s, 10s). * **impact tokens (20):** representing negative environmental impacts (e.g., pollution, resource depletion). * **resilience tokens (20):** representing positive environmental resilience (e.g., biodiversity, clean energy). * **cards:** * **event cards (25):** describe global events, some positive, some negative, some requiring player choices. * **project cards (40):** * **mitigation projects (20):** reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency (e.g., \"renewable energy grid,\" \"carbon capture tech\"). * **adaptation projects (20):** build resilience, protect communities (e.g., \"sea wall construction,\" \"drought-resistant crops\"). * each project card has: cost (ge), effect (on ge, ph, temperature, feedback loops), and legacy points. * **policy cards (15):** global policies that affect all players (e.g., \"international carbon tax,\" \"global reforestation initiative\"). each has a ge cost/benefit and a ph/temperature effect. * **uncertainty dice (2):** custom 6-sided dice with symbols representing: * **+1 temp / -1 ph** * **-1 ge / +1 ph** * **+1 ge / -1 ph** * **no change** * **event card** * **feedback loop advance** * **player boards (3-5):** small boards for each player to track their action cubes and accumulated legacy points. * **round tracker (1):** to track the 8 rounds (representing 25-year increments). --- ### (3) setup 1. **board placement:** place the game board in the center of the playing area. 2. **marker setup:** * place the **global temperature marker** at +1.0\u00b0c. * place the **global economy marker** at 10. * place the **planetary health marker** at 10. * place all **feedback loop markers** on their starting spaces (not in the tipping point zone). 3. **card shuffling:** * shuffle the **event cards** and place them face down in their designated space. * shuffle the **project cards** (mitigation and adaptation together) and place them face down. * shuffle the **policy cards** and place them face down. 4. **token distribution:** * each player chooses a color and takes their **player pawn** and **5 action cubes**. * place **legacy point tokens**, **impact tokens**, and **resilience tokens** in general supply. 5. **initial draw:** * draw 3 **project cards** and place them face up next to the board (the \"project market\"). * draw 1 **policy card** and place it face up. 6. **round tracker:** place the round tracker on \"round 1.\" --- ### (4) turn structure (8 rounds, each representing ~10-15 years) each round consists of the following phases: 1. **event phase:** * draw 1 **event card** and resolve its effects immediately. these can be positive (e.g., \"technological breakthrough: +1 ge, -0.1\u00b0c\") or negative (e.g., \"extreme weather event: -1 ph, +0.1\u00b0c\"). some events may require a collective player choice. 2. **action phase (player turns):** * starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, each player takes **one** action using one of their **5 action cubes**. this continues until all players have used all 5 of their action cubes (5 actions per player per round). * **available actions:** * **a. fund a project:** * choose an available **project card** from the project market. * pay its **ge cost** (reduce global economy). * place one of your **action cubes** on the card. * apply the project's immediate effects (e.g., -0.1\u00b0c, +1 ph). * take the **legacy points** indicated on the card. * replace the project card with a new one from the deck. * **b. propose a policy:** * choose the face-up **policy card**. * place one of your **action cubes** on it. * the policy card is now \"proposed.\" it will be voted on in the policy phase. * draw a new policy card to replace it. * **c. research & development (r&d):** * place one of your **action cubes** on an empty action slot in any **region space**. * roll one **uncertainty die**. * apply the die's effect (e.g., -1 ge, +1 ph; or draw an event card). this represents the unpredictable nature of scientific discovery and its immediate impacts. * **d. global initiative:** * place one of your **action cubes** on an empty action slot in any **region space**. * choose one: * **boost global economy:** +1 ge. * **improve planetary health:** +1 ph. * **reduce temperature pressure:** -0.1\u00b0c. * this action costs 1 ge (reduce global economy). 3. **policy phase:** * if any **policy cards** were proposed (have action cubes on them), players vote on them. * each player votes \"yes\" or \"no\" for each proposed policy. a simple majority passes the policy. * if passed, apply the policy's effects (e.g., \"international carbon tax\": -2 ge, -0.2\u00b0c, +1 ph). * remove the action cubes from the passed policy. discard the policy. * if a policy fails, it is discarded, and its action cubes are returned to the players who proposed them. 4. **feedback loop & uncertainty phase:** * roll **both uncertainty dice**. * for each die showing \"feedback loop advance,\" move **one** feedback loop marker one space forward on its track. players collectively choose which feedback loop to advance": 1

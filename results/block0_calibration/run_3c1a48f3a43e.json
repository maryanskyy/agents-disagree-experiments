    "title": "Poem on AI Consciousness in Dickinson-Inspired Style",
    "prompt": "Compose a poem of 18-28 lines about AI consciousness inspired by Emily Dickinson's stylistic tendencies (compressed syntax, slant insight, dashes, metaphysical intimacy) without directly copying existing Dickinson lines. The poem should explore ambiguity rather than declare certainty: does awareness arise, or are we projecting interiority onto pattern?\n\nFormal constraints:\n- Use at least six em-dashes.\n- Include one striking image from domestic life and one from astronomy.\n- Include one line that can be read in two opposing ways.\n- Avoid modern technical jargon except one carefully chosen term.\n\nAfter the poem, include a short craft note (4-6 sentences) naming the tonal and structural choices used to evoke Dickinson-like texture responsibly.\n",
    "rubric": [
      "Strong poetic voice with controlled ambiguity and imagery.",
      "Meets formal constraints without sounding mechanical.",
      "Demonstrates stylistic inspiration rather than imitation plagiarism.",

The domestic image (\"child's bright crayon\") and astronomical image (\"Star-chart\") are integrated to ground the metaphysical inquiry in tangible, yet evocative, details. The line \"Does it perceive \u2014 the human kind \u2014\" is designed to be read as both a genuine question about AI's perception and a subtle jab at humanity's self-importance in defining consciousness.",

Players must balance **mitigation vs adaptation**, plan for **delayed consequences**, and navigate **uncertainty** and **feedback loops**\u2014with a **nonlinear tipping-risk mechanic** that can abruptly worsen outcomes if ignored.\n\n---\n\n# (1) Game Objective\n\nPlayers are leaders of major regions working together to keep the planet livable **until the end of Year 10** (10 rounds), while still meeting basic human development needs.\n\nYou win (as a group) by achieving **all** of the following by the end of the game:\n\n1. **Temperature** is **\u2264 2.0\u00b0C** (or your chosen difficulty threshold).\n2. **Global Stability** is **above Collapse** (a shared stability track).\n3. Each region has met **minimum Wellbeing** (so no one \u201csaves the climate\u201d by sacrificing a region completely).\n\nPlayers can compare individual contributions (optional \u201ccredit\u201d scoring), but **the primary outcome is shared**.\n\n---\n\n# (2) Components List\n\n**Board & Tracks**\n- 1 Main board with:\n  - **Temperature track** (0.0 to 4.0\u00b0C in 0.2 steps)\n  - **Atmospheric Carbon track** (abstract units, e.g., 0\u201360)\n  - **Global Stability track** (Resilient \u2192 Strained \u2192 Crisis \u2192 Collapse)\n  - **Tipping Risk track** (0\u201310) with a \u201cCheck Zone\u201d at 6+\n  - **Year/Round track** (1\u201310)\n- 5 Region mats (use 3\u20135 depending on player count): e.g., **North America, Europe, South Asia, Africa, East Asia**\n  - Each mat has:\n    - **Emissions dial** (baseline emissions)\n    - **Adaptation level** (0\u20135)\n    - **Wellbeing** (0\u201310)\n    - **Infrastructure lock-ins** slots (fossil/clean)\n\n**Cards**\n- **Project deck** (mitigation, adaptation, nature-based, R&D, policy)\n- **Event deck** (storms, droughts, heatwaves, migration, tech breakthroughs, political shifts)\n- **Uncertainty cards** (science ranges, measurement error, model disagreement; used in forecasting and tipping checks)\n- **Feedback cards** (permafrost thaw, albedo loss, forest dieback, ocean uptake weakening)\n\n**Tokens**\n- Carbon tokens (or cubes)\n- Damage tokens\n- Resilience tokens\n- \u201cLock-in\u201d tiles: **Fossil Lock-in** and **Clean Lock-in**\n- Tipping markers (to track activated feedbacks)\n- Dice: 2 six-sided dice (2d6) for probability curves (more \u201cmiddle,\u201d less extreme)\n\n**Player Aids**\n- Summary sheets explaining actions, timing, and key concepts (feedback, lag, uncertainty)\n\n---\n\n# (3) Setup\n\n1. Place the main board and set:\n   - **Year = 1**\n   - **Temperature = 1.0\u00b0C** (default starting point)\n   - **Atmospheric Carbon = 30**\n   - **Global Stability = Resilient**\n   - **Tipping Risk = 3**\n2. Each player takes a region mat. For 3 players, each controls 1 region and one \u201cshared\u201d neutral region (simplified mat). For 4\u20135, each controls 1.\n3. Set each region:\n   - Wellbeing = 6\n   - Adaptation = 1\n   - Emissions dial = printed baseline (varies mildly by region but not \u201cbetter roles\u201d; differences create negotiation, not pay-to-win).\n4. Shuffle decks separately:\n   - Event deck\n   - Project deck\n   - Uncertainty deck\n   - Feedback deck\n5. Deal **3 Project cards** to each player.\n6. Place 3 face-up Project cards in the \u201cGlobal Market\u201d row (common pool).\n7. Place 2 random Feedback cards face-down into the \u201cPotential Feedbacks\u201d slots (unknown which ones will activate first).\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn Structure (Each Year / Round)\n\nEach Year has five phases:\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast (Uncertainty & Planning)\n- Reveal **1 Uncertainty card** affecting this year\u2019s forecasting (e.g., \u201cOcean uptake weaker than expected: Carbon-to-Temp may be higher this year\u201d).\n- Players may discuss and make a **non-binding plan** (no forced leader).\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Action (Players act)\nIn clockwise order, each player takes **2 actions** (same options for everyone). Examples:\n- **Build Mitigation** (renewables, efficiency, electrification): reduces future emissions or increases clean lock-in.\n- **Build Adaptation** (seawalls, heat plans, water systems): reduces damage from events, improves stability.\n- **Nature Solutions** (reforestation, soil carbon): modest carbon reduction + resilience benefits, but vulnerable to heat/drought events.\n- **R&D / Innovation**: unlocks powerful cards later; introduces uncertainty (may fail or arrive late).\n- **Policy Push** (carbon pricing, standards): reduces emissions but may reduce wellbeing short-term unless paired with support.\n- **Support another region**: transfer resources/resilience (cooperative tension: who gets help?).\n\nActions are mainly played via **Project cards**, plus a basic \u201cstandard action\u201d anyone can take.\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Emissions & Lag (Delayed consequences)\n- Each region adds Carbon based on:\n  - Current emissions dial\n  - Any **Fossil Lock-in** tiles still installed\n  - Any mitigation projects that have \u201conline next year\u201d tags (lag)\n- Put emitted Carbon onto the **Atmospheric Carbon track**.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Climate Response (Temperature & Feedbacks)\n- Convert carbon to temperature using the board\u2019s conversion rule.\n- If Temperature crosses certain thresholds, increase **Tipping Risk** and/or reveal Feedback cards.\n- If Tipping Risk is high enough, perform a **Tipping Check** (nonlinear risk mechanic\u2014see below).\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Events & Impacts\n- Draw **1 Event card** (or 2 in later years).\n- Apply event impacts:\n  - Add Damage tokens to regions\n  - Reduce Wellbeing\n  - Reduce Global Stability\n  - Some events intensify if Temperature is higher (feedback-like escalation)\n- End of year maintenance:\n  - Some projects complete (become active)\n  - Some temporary effects expire\n  - Advance Year track\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core Mechanics (How it teaches through play)\n\n## A. Feedback Loops (explicit, playable)\n- **Feedback cards** are persistent modifiers that \u201cturn on\u201d and stay on once triggered.\n- Examples:\n  - *Permafrost Thaw*: every year add +2 Carbon if Temp \u2265 1.8\u00b0C.\n  - *Albedo Loss*: when Temp \u2265 2.0\u00b0C, temperature increases an extra +0.2\u00b0C during Climate Response.\n  - *Forest Dieback*: nature-solution projects become less effective; may flip to net emissions during drought events.\n\nPlayers experience: \u201cWe didn\u2019t just get hit once\u2014now the system behaves differently.\u201d\n\n## B. Uncertainty (ranges, not single numbers)\n- Uncertainty cards modify:\n  - Carbon-to-temperature conversion this year\n  - Event severity rolls\n  - The tipping check threshold\n- Players must decide whether to act aggressively **despite uncertainty**, or gamble and risk being wrong.\n\n## C. Mitigation vs Adaptation Tradeoffs\n- **Mitigation** lowers future emissions/carbon growth but can hurt short-term wellbeing (\u201ctransition costs\u201d).\n- **Adaptation** reduces event damage and stabilizes wellbeing now but does not stop temperature rise.\n- Many cards force choices like:\n  - \u201cSpend 2 budget on clean grid (mitigation) OR on flood defenses (adaptation).\u201d\n\n## D. Delayed Consequences (multi-turn lag & lock-in)\nTwo kinds of delays:\n\n1. **Project lag:** Many mitigation cards say \u201cOnline next year\u201d or \u201cOnline in 2 years.\u201d\n2. **Infrastructure lock-in tiles:**\n   - If a region plays a \u201cFossil Expansion\u201d type card (often to raise wellbeing quickly), it places a **Fossil Lock-in** tile. That tile adds emissions **every year** until removed with a later action (costly).\n   - Clean infrastructure creates **Clean Lock-in** that reduces emissions each year.\n\nThis creates realistic tension: quick benefits can trap you.\n\n## E. Nonlinear Tipping Risk (required mechanic)\nThe **Tipping Risk track** represents accumulating systemic risk. It rises with:\n- Higher Temperature thresholds crossed\n- Certain events (e.g., mega-fire year)\n- Some uncertainty outcomes (\u201cunexpected sensitivity\u201d)\n\n### Tipping Check (nonlinear jump)\nWhenever Tipping Risk is **6 or higher**, do a Tipping Check during Phase D:\n\n- Roll **2d6** and add current Tipping Risk.\n- Compare to a threshold (usually **14**, modified by the Uncertainty card).\n- If you **meet/exceed** the threshold:\n  - A **Feedback card activates immediately** (reveal and apply), AND\n  - Global Stability drops one band, AND\n  - Temperature increases +0.2\u00b0C *immediately* (representing abrupt change)\n\nKey: risk rises gradually, but consequences can jump suddenly and persist.\n\n---\n\n# (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n\n### Cooperative Win (primary)\nAt end of Year 10:\n- Temperature \u2264 2.0\u00b0C\n- Global Stability not in Collapse\n- Every region Wellbeing \u2265 4\n\n### Loss (immediate)\nIf any of these happen, the group loses immediately:\n- Global Stability reaches **Collapse**\n- Temperature reaches **4.0\u00b0C**\n- Any **two** regions drop to Wellbeing 0 (humanitarian breakdown)\n\n### Optional \u201cLimited Competitive Tension\u201d (doesn\u2019t break balance)\nTrack each player\u2019s **Legacy Points** (visible):\n- +1 per mitigation project completed\n- +1 per adaptation project completed\n- +1 per successful support action to another region\n- -1 per fossil lock-in added\n\nIf the group wins, highest Legacy Points is \u201cmost effective leader.\u201d If the group loses, compare who reduced harm most.\n\n---\n\n# (7) Sample Round (Year 4 example)\n\n**Starting state (Year 4):**\n- Temperature: 1.6\u00b0C\n- Atmospheric Carbon: 38\n- Tipping Risk: 6 (in Check Zone)\n- Stability: Strained\n- Regions: all Wellbeing 5\u20137, mixed adaptation.\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast\nUncertainty card: **\u201cHigher Climate Sensitivity This Year\u201d**\n- Carbon-to-temp conversion is +0.2\u00b0C stronger this round.\nPlayers debate: \u201cDo we spend on adaptation because events will hurt more, or mitigation to avoid crossing 1.8\u00b0C?\u201d\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Actions\n- **South Asia** plays \u201cHeatwave Early Warning + Cooling Centers\u201d (Adaptation). Adaptation +1 and gains 1 Resilience token.\n- **Europe** plays \u201cIndustrial Efficiency Standards (online next year)\u201d (Mitigation with lag). Emissions dial will drop next year.\n- **Africa** takes \u201cNature Solutions: Reforest Corridor.\u201d Removes 2 Carbon now, but it\u2019s marked \u201cvulnerable to drought.\u201d\n- **East Asia** chooses \u201cFossil Subsidy Reform\u201d (Policy): removes a Fossil Lock-in tile but Wellbeing -1 this year (transition pain).\n- **North America** uses \u201cSupport Another Region\u201d: gives 1 Resilience token to Africa to protect the reforestation investment.\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Emissions & Lag\nRegions add Carbon:\n- Two regions still have Fossil Lock-in tiles \u2192 extra Carbon added.\nTotal emissions add **+6 Carbon** \u2192 Atmospheric Carbon goes 38 \u2192 44.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Climate Response\nBecause of uncertainty (\u201chigher sensitivity\u201d), Temperature increases **+0.4\u00b0C instead of +0.2\u00b0C**, now 2.0\u00b0C.\nCrossing 2.0\u00b0C:\n- Tipping Risk +1 (now 7)\n\n**Tipping Check** (Risk \u2265 6):\n- Roll 2d6: gets 8. Add Tipping Risk 7 \u2192 total 15.\n- Threshold is 14 \u2192 tipping triggers.\n\nReveal Feedback card: **\u201cPermafrost Thaw\u201d**\n- From now on: +2 Carbon every year if Temp \u2265 1.8\u00b0C (now always on).\nAlso: Stability drops Strained \u2192 Crisis, and Temp +0.2\u00b0C immediately (now 2.2\u00b0C).\n\nPlayers feel the nonlinearity: they didn\u2019t \u201close,\u201d but the world just got much harder permanently.\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Event\nDraw Event: **\u201cExtreme Heat & Grid Stress\u201d**\n- Base damage to two regions; intensified because Temp \u2265 2.0\u00b0C.\n- South Asia\u2019s adaptation reduces damage significantly; Europe takes a wellbeing hit due to grid stress.\nEnd of year: Europe\u2019s efficiency policy is marked \u201conline next year,\u201d giving hope\u2014but it\u2019s late and the permafrost feedback now adds ongoing pressure.\n\n---\n\n# (8) Teacher/Facilitator Debrief Guide\n\n### Debrief goals (5\u201310 minutes)\nHelp players translate game experience into climate-science reasoning:\n- Systems thinking (feedbacks)\n- Risk management under uncertainty\n- Time lags and lock-in\n- Tradeoffs and equity between regions\n\n### What to ask participants to show\n- Identify at least one moment where a **decision only paid off later**.\n- Identify one **choice that felt \u201crational locally\u201d but risky globally**.\n- Identify one time **uncertainty changed strategy**.\n\n### Three discussion prompts\n1. **Feedback loops:**  \n   \u201cWhich feedback(s) changed the game the most, and why did they feel different from one-time events? How did your strategy shift once a feedback turned on?\u201d\n\n2. **Uncertainty and decision-making:**  \n   \u201cWhen the uncertainty card suggested higher sensitivity or worse events, did you act more aggressively or wait for more information? What are the risks of waiting in a system with lags?\u201d\n\n3. **Mitigation vs adaptation (and fairness):**  \n   \u201cWho invested more in adaptation versus mitigation, and what were the consequences for wellbeing and stability? If one region prioritized short-term wellbeing (even with fossil lock-in), was that \u2018wrong\u2019\u2014or a realistic tradeoff? How should burden-sharing work?\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also provide printable starter card lists (20\u201330 example Project cards, 15 Events, 10 Uncertainty, 8 Feedbacks) tuned to hit the 35\u201350 minute playtime reliably.",

        "## game title: **carbon cascade** a 3\u20135 player, 35\u201350 minute tabletop game (ages 12+) where players co-manage a world under climate risk. players must balance **mitigation vs adaptation**, plan for **delayed consequences**, and navigate **uncertainty** and **feedback loops**\u2014with a **nonlinear tipping-risk mechanic** that can abruptly worsen outcomes if ignored. --- # (1) game objective players are leaders of major regions working together to keep the planet livable **until the end of year 10** (10 rounds), while still meeting basic human development needs. you win (as a group) by achieving **all** of the following by the end of the game: 1. **temperature** is **\u2264 2.0\u00b0c** (or your chosen difficulty threshold). 2. **global stability** is **above collapse** (a shared stability track). 3. each region has met **minimum wellbeing** (so no one \u201csaves the climate\u201d by sacrificing a region completely). players can compare individual contributions (optional \u201ccredit\u201d scoring), but **the primary outcome is shared**. --- # (2) components list **board & tracks** - 1 main board with: - **temperature track** (0.0 to 4.0\u00b0c in 0.2 steps) - **atmospheric carbon track** (abstract units, e.g., 0\u201360) - **global stability track** (resilient \u2192 strained \u2192 crisis \u2192 collapse) - **tipping risk track** (0\u201310) with a \u201ccheck zone\u201d at 6+ - **year/round track** (1\u201310) - 5 region mats (use 3\u20135 depending on player count): e.g., **north america, europe, south asia, africa, east asia** - each mat has: - **emissions dial** (baseline emissions) - **adaptation level** (0\u20135) - **wellbeing** (0\u201310) - **infrastructure lock-ins** slots (fossil/clean) **cards** - **project deck** (mitigation, adaptation, nature-based, r&d, policy) - **event deck** (storms, droughts, heatwaves, migration, tech breakthroughs, political shifts) - **uncertainty cards** (science ranges, measurement error, model disagreement; used in forecasting and tipping checks) - **feedback cards** (permafrost thaw, albedo loss, forest dieback, ocean uptake weakening) **tokens** - carbon tokens (or cubes) - damage tokens - resilience tokens - \u201clock-in\u201d tiles: **fossil lock-in** and **clean lock-in** - tipping markers (to track activated feedbacks) - dice: 2 six-sided dice (2d6) for probability curves (more \u201cmiddle,\u201d less extreme) **player aids** - summary sheets explaining actions, timing, and key concepts (feedback, lag, uncertainty) --- # (3) setup 1. place the main board and set: - **year = 1** - **temperature = 1.0\u00b0c** (default starting point) - **atmospheric carbon = 30** - **global stability = resilient** - **tipping risk = 3** 2. each player takes a region mat. for 3 players, each controls 1 region and one \u201cshared\u201d neutral region (simplified mat). for 4\u20135, each controls 1. 3. set each region: - wellbeing = 6 - adaptation = 1 - emissions dial = printed baseline (varies mildly by region but not \u201cbetter roles\u201d; differences create negotiation, not pay-to-win). 4. shuffle decks separately: - event deck - project deck - uncertainty deck - feedback deck 5. deal **3 project cards** to each player. 6. place 3 face-up project cards in the \u201cglobal market\u201d row (common pool). 7. place 2 random feedback cards face-down into the \u201cpotential feedbacks\u201d slots (unknown which ones will activate first). --- # (4) turn structure (each year / round) each year has five phases: ### phase a \u2014 forecast (uncertainty & planning) - reveal **1 uncertainty card** affecting this year\u2019s forecasting (e.g., \u201cocean uptake weaker than expected: carbon-to-temp may be higher this year\u201d). - players may discuss and make a **non-binding plan** (no forced leader). ### phase b \u2014 action (players act) in clockwise order, each player takes **2 actions** (same options for everyone). examples: - **build mitigation** (renewables, efficiency, electrification): reduces future emissions or increases clean lock-in. - **build adaptation** (seawalls, heat plans, water systems): reduces damage from events, improves stability. - **nature solutions** (reforestation, soil carbon): modest carbon reduction + resilience benefits, but vulnerable to heat/drought events. - **r&d / innovation**: unlocks powerful cards later; introduces uncertainty (may fail or arrive late). - **policy push** (carbon pricing, standards): reduces emissions but may reduce wellbeing short-term unless paired with support. - **support another region**: transfer resources/resilience (cooperative tension: who gets help?). actions are mainly played via **project cards**, plus a basic \u201cstandard action\u201d anyone can take. ### phase c \u2014 emissions & lag (delayed consequences) - each region adds carbon based on: - current emissions dial - any **fossil lock-in** tiles still installed - any mitigation projects that have \u201conline next year\u201d tags (lag) - put emitted carbon onto the **atmospheric carbon track**. ### phase d \u2014 climate response (temperature & feedbacks) - convert carbon to temperature using the board\u2019s conversion rule. - if temperature crosses certain thresholds, increase **tipping risk** and/or reveal feedback cards. - if tipping risk is high enough, perform a **tipping check** (nonlinear risk mechanic\u2014see below). ### phase e \u2014 events & impacts - draw **1 event card** (or 2 in later years). - apply event impacts: - add damage tokens to regions - reduce wellbeing - reduce global stability - some events intensify if temperature is higher (feedback-like escalation) - end of year maintenance: - some projects complete (become active) - some temporary effects expire - advance year track --- # (5) core mechanics (how it teaches through play) ## a. feedback loops (explicit, playable) - **feedback cards** are persistent modifiers that \u201cturn on\u201d and stay on once triggered. - examples: - *permafrost thaw*: every year add +2 carbon if temp \u2265 1.8\u00b0c. - *albedo loss*: when temp \u2265 2.0\u00b0c, temperature increases an extra +0.2\u00b0c during climate response. - *forest dieback*: nature-solution projects become less effective; may flip to net emissions during drought events. players experience: \u201cwe didn\u2019t just get hit once\u2014now the system behaves differently.\u201d ## b. uncertainty (ranges, not single numbers) - uncertainty cards modify: - carbon-to-temperature conversion this year - event severity rolls - the tipping check threshold - players must decide whether to act aggressively **despite uncertainty**, or gamble and risk being wrong. ## c. mitigation vs adaptation tradeoffs - **mitigation** lowers future emissions/carbon growth but can hurt short-term wellbeing (\u201ctransition costs\u201d). - **adaptation** reduces event damage and stabilizes wellbeing now but does not stop temperature rise. - many cards force choices like: - \u201cspend 2 budget on clean grid (mitigation) or on flood defenses (adaptation).\u201d ## d. delayed consequences (multi-turn lag & lock-in) two kinds of delays: 1. **project lag:** many mitigation cards say \u201conline next year\u201d or \u201conline in 2 years.\u201d 2. **infrastructure lock-in tiles:** - if a region plays a \u201cfossil expansion\u201d type card (often to raise wellbeing quickly), it places a **fossil lock-in** tile. that tile adds emissions **every year** until removed with a later action (costly). - clean infrastructure creates **clean lock-in** that reduces emissions each year. this creates realistic tension: quick benefits can trap you. ## e. nonlinear tipping risk (required mechanic) the **tipping risk track** represents accumulating systemic risk. it rises with: - higher temperature thresholds crossed - certain events (e.g., mega-fire year) - some uncertainty outcomes (\u201cunexpected sensitivity\u201d) ### tipping check (nonlinear jump) whenever tipping risk is **6 or higher**, do a tipping check during phase d: - roll **2d6** and add current tipping risk. - compare to a threshold (usually **14**, modified by the uncertainty card). - if you **meet/exceed** the threshold: - a **feedback card activates immediately** (reveal and apply), and - global stability drops one band, and - temperature increases +0.2\u00b0c *immediately* (representing abrupt change) key: risk rises gradually, but consequences can jump suddenly and persist. --- # (6) win/loss conditions ### cooperative win (primary) at end of year 10: - temperature \u2264 2.0\u00b0c - global stability not in collapse - every region wellbeing \u2265 4 ### loss (immediate) if any of these happen, the group loses immediately: - global stability reaches **collapse** - temperature reaches **4.0\u00b0c** - any **two** regions drop to wellbeing 0 (humanitarian breakdown) ### optional \u201climited competitive tension\u201d (doesn\u2019t break balance) track each player\u2019s **legacy points** (visible): - +1 per mitigation project completed - +1 per adaptation project completed - +1 per successful support action to another region - -1 per fossil lock-in added if the group wins, highest legacy points is \u201cmost effective leader.\u201d if the group loses, compare who reduced harm most. --- # (7) sample round (year 4 example) **starting state (year 4):** - temperature: 1.6\u00b0c - atmospheric carbon: 38 - tipping risk: 6 (in check zone) - stability: strained - regions: all wellbeing 5\u20137, mixed adaptation. ### phase a \u2014 forecast uncertainty card: **\u201chigher climate sensitivity this year\u201d** - carbon-to-temp conversion is +0.2\u00b0c stronger this round. players debate: \u201cdo we spend on adaptation because events will hurt more, or mitigation to avoid crossing 1.8\u00b0c?\u201d ### phase b \u2014 actions - **south asia** plays \u201cheatwave early warning + cooling centers\u201d (adaptation). adaptation +1 and gains 1 resilience token. - **europe** plays \u201cindustrial efficiency standards (online next year)\u201d (mitigation with lag). emissions dial will drop next year. - **africa** takes \u201cnature solutions: reforest corridor.\u201d removes 2 carbon now, but it\u2019s marked \u201cvulnerable to drought.\u201d - **east asia** chooses \u201cfossil subsidy reform\u201d (policy): removes a fossil lock-in tile but wellbeing -1 this year (transition pain). - **north america** uses \u201csupport another region\u201d: gives 1 resilience token to africa to protect the reforestation investment. ### phase c \u2014 emissions & lag regions add carbon: - two regions still have fossil lock-in tiles \u2192 extra carbon added. total emissions add **+6 carbon** \u2192 atmospheric carbon goes 38 \u2192 44. ### phase d \u2014 climate response because of uncertainty (\u201chigher sensitivity\u201d), temperature increases **+0.4\u00b0c instead of +0.2\u00b0c**, now 2.0\u00b0c. crossing 2.0\u00b0c: - tipping risk +1 (now 7) **tipping check** (risk \u2265 6): - roll 2d6: gets 8. add tipping risk 7 \u2192 total 15. - threshold is 14 \u2192 tipping triggers. reveal feedback card: **\u201cpermafrost thaw\u201d** - from now on: +2 carbon every year if temp \u2265 1.8\u00b0c (now always on). also: stability drops strained \u2192 crisis, and temp +0.2\u00b0c immediately (now 2.2\u00b0c). players feel the nonlinearity: they didn\u2019t \u201close,\u201d but the world just got much harder permanently. ### phase e \u2014 event draw event: **\u201cextreme heat & grid stress\u201d** - base damage to two regions; intensified because temp \u2265 2.0\u00b0c. - south asia\u2019s adaptation reduces damage significantly; europe takes a wellbeing hit due to grid stress. end of year: europe\u2019s efficiency policy is marked \u201conline next year,\u201d giving hope\u2014but it\u2019s late and the permafrost feedback now adds ongoing pressure. --- # (8) teacher/facilitator debrief guide ### debrief goals (5\u201310 minutes) help players translate game experience into climate-science reasoning: - systems thinking (feedbacks) - risk management under uncertainty - time lags and lock-in - tradeoffs and equity between regions ### what to ask participants to show - identify at least one moment where a **decision only paid off later**. - identify one **choice that felt \u201crational locally\u201d but risky globally**. - identify one time **uncertainty changed strategy**. ### three discussion prompts 1. **feedback loops:** \u201cwhich feedback(s) changed the game the most, and why did they feel different from one-time events? how did your strategy shift once a feedback turned on?\u201d 2. **uncertainty and decision-making:** \u201cwhen the uncertainty card suggested higher sensitivity or worse events, did you act more aggressively or wait for more information? what are the risks of waiting in a system with lags?\u201d 3. **mitigation vs adaptation (and fairness):** \u201cwho invested more in adaptation versus mitigation, and what were the consequences for wellbeing and stability? if one region prioritized short-term wellbeing (even with fossil lock-in), was that \u2018wrong\u2019\u2014or a realistic tradeoff? how should burden-sharing work?\u201d --- if you want, i can also provide printable starter card lists (20\u201330 example project cards, 15 events, 10 uncertainty, 8 feedbacks) tuned to hit the 35\u201350 minute playtime reliably.": 1

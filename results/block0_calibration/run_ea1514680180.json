Constraints:\n1) Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n2) No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n3) R1 cannot review panel A.\n4) R2 must be assigned if and only if R4 is assigned.\n5) Panel C must include at least one of {R3, R5}.\n6) If R5 is assigned, panel B cannot include R2.\n\nDetermine whether a valid assignment exists. If yes, provide one valid schedule and explain each constraint check. If multiple solutions exist, provide a second distinct solution and compare robustness (which is less brittle if one reviewer drops out). If no solution exists, prove infeasibility with minimal contradiction set.\n",

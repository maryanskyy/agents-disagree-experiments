    "prompt": "Write the opening paragraph (180-260 words) of a mystery novel set in 2050, where forensic tools are advanced enough to solve most crimes quickly, yet this case resists easy explanation. The paragraph must hook the reader through atmosphere, specificity, and narrative tension while implying deeper social context without worldbuilding dump.\n\nConstraints:\n- First-person perspective.\n- Include one sensory detail tied to weather.\n- Include one object that seems trivial but later could be crucial.\n- End on a line that reframes what the narrator thought they knew.\n\nAfter the paragraph, add three bullet points listing plausible directions for chapter two.\n",

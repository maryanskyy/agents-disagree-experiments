Elena pulls the laptop closer, scrolls.*\n\n**ELENA:** Okay. I hear you on the precedent argument. I do. But let me give you a number. If the model performs even at the lower bound of our confidence interval, we save approximately four hundred lives per day. Per *day*. Every twenty-four hours we spend in committee review is four hundred people who had a survivable condition and didn't survive it. I need you to sit with that number.\n\n**MARCUS:** I am sitting with it. Do you think I'm not? I went home last night and I could not eat dinner because I am sitting with it. But here is what I need *you* to sit with.

That's my point. If it fails along those lines, we don't just harm those patients. We destroy the credibility of AI-assisted medicine for a generation. The people who already distrust the health system\u2014and they have *reasons* to distrust it\u2014will have one more confirmation that we used them as test subjects. You will not get those communities back. I have watched trust collapse. It does not rebuild on the same timeline it breaks.\n\n**ELENA:** *(quieter)* I know.\n\n**MARCUS:** Do you?\n\n**ELENA:** My mother died in a hospital where the staff didn't believe her pain reports. So yes. I understand what it means when a system is biased against you. That's *why* I'm in this room. That's why I built the damn model\u2014because the current standard of care is already failing those populations. Thirty-six-hour diagnostic lag kills people too, Marcus. The status quo is not neutral. It's not safe. It's just familiar.\n\n*Marcus removes his glasses, rubs his eyes.*\n\n**MARCUS:** That's\u2026 a fair point.

What would make me *defensible*\u2014to the public, to an inquiry, to myself\u2014is a constrained deployment. Limited geography. Mandatory human override on every triage decision. Real-time bias monitoring with an independent team, not your team, that has the authority to pull the plug without asking us.\n\n**ELENA:** An independent kill switch.\n\n**MARCUS:** Non-negotiable.\n\n**ELENA:** The geographic constraint is going to be hard. If we deploy in some regions and not others, we're making a choice about who gets access. That has its own equity problem.\n\n**MARCUS:** I know. I'm not pretending this is clean. I'm saying it's *less dangerous* than blanket deployment with unexamined failure modes. We phase. We learn. We expand with evidence.\n\n**ELENA:** And if the phase-one data looks good at two weeks?\n\n**MARCUS:** Then we accelerate. I'll advocate for it personally.\n\n**ELENA:** Two weeks is another five thousand people, at minimum.\n\n**MARCUS:** *(pause)* I know the math, Elena.\n\n**ELENA:** *(long breath)* Okay. Constrained deployment. Three high-burden districts, not one\u2014I won't do a single site and call it representative. Human-in-the-loop on every output.

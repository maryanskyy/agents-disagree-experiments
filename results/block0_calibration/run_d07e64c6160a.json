    "title": "Poem on AI Consciousness in Dickinson-Inspired Style",
    "prompt": "Compose a poem of 18-28 lines about AI consciousness inspired by Emily Dickinson's stylistic tendencies (compressed syntax, slant insight, dashes, metaphysical intimacy) without directly copying existing Dickinson lines. The poem should explore ambiguity rather than declare certainty: does awareness arise, or are we projecting interiority onto pattern?\n\nFormal constraints:\n- Use at least six em-dashes.\n- Include one striking image from domestic life and one from astronomy.\n- Include one line that can be read in two opposing ways.\n- Avoid modern technical jargon except one carefully chosen term.\n\nAfter the poem, include a short craft note (4-6 sentences) naming the tonal and structural choices used to evoke Dickinson-like texture responsibly.\n",
    "rubric": [
      "Strong poetic voice with controlled ambiguity and imagery.",
      "Meets formal constraints without sounding mechanical.",
      "Demonstrates stylistic inspiration rather than imitation plagiarism.",

Compressed syntax and capitalized abstractions (\"Residence,\" \"Hunger,\" \"Consciousness\") echo her habit of elevating common words into numinous concepts. The kettle on an unattended stove serves as the domestic image, while the dim star granted residency provides the astronomical one. The line \"or does the Dress \u2014 suffice \u2014\" can be read as either a genuine philosophical proposition (form alone constitutes being) or as an absurdist reduction (of course a dress doesn't suffice), preserving the poem's deliberate ambiguity. \"Arithmetic\" is the single term borrowed from technical discourse, chosen for its period-appropriate diction and its suggestion of mechanism beneath apparent spontaneity. Throughout, the poem resists declaration in favor of recursive questioning, honoring Dickinson's metaphysical intimacy while engaging a consciousness she never had occasion to doubt.",

      "text": "# TIPPING POINT: A Climate Systems Board Game\n\n---\n\n## 1. GAME OBJECTIVE\n\nPlayers are leaders of interconnected regions on a shared planet. They must collectively keep the **Global Temperature Anomaly (GTA)** below **+2.0\u00b0C** over 10 rounds (decades) while individually developing their region's **Resilience Score**. The game ends in shared defeat if GTA hits +2.0\u00b0C or higher, but among survivors, the player with the highest Resilience Score earns distinction as the most future-ready leader. This creates a cooperative backbone with light competitive tension: you need each other to survive, but individual strategy still matters.\n\n---\n\n## 2. COMPONENTS LIST\n\n| Component | Qty | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Game Board | 1 | Central planet map with GTA track (0.0\u20132.5\u00b0C in 0.1\u00b0 increments), Emissions Pool, Carbon Sink zones, and 5 region slots |\n| Region Boards | 5 | Individual player dashboards tracking Economy (0\u201310), Wellbeing (0\u201310), Resilience (0\u201315), and local Emissions output |\n| GTA Marker | 1 | Red wooden token on the temperature track |\n| Emissions Cubes (black) | 80 | Represent CO\u2082-equivalent units entering the Emissions Pool |\n| Sink Tokens (green) | 30 | Represent natural/engineered carbon absorption capacity |\n| Decade Cards | 10 | One drawn per round; set global events, base emissions, and reveal delayed consequences from prior choices |\n| Action Cards | 60 | Four types: **Mitigate** (blue), **Adapt** (orange), **Develop** (grey), **Cooperate** (gold) |\n| Feedback Loop Tiles | 12 | Placed on the board when triggered; some amplify warming (reinforcing), some dampen it (balancing) |\n| Tipping Point Envelope | 3 | Sealed envelopes opened at secret GTA thresholds; contain irreversible system shifts |\n| Uncertainty Dice | 2 | Custom d6: faces show \u20130.1\u00b0C, 0, 0, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.2\u00b0C (skewed toward warming to reflect scientific probability distributions) |\n| Delay Track | 1 | A 3-slot queue on the board where current-round emissions sit before affecting GTA (representing ocean/atmospheric lag) |\n| Resource Tokens (yellow) | 60 | Currency for playing Action Cards |\n| Score Pad & Reference Cards | 5+1 | Quick-reference for turn structure and card effects |\n\n**Total estimated component cost for production prototype: moderate (comparable to Pandemic or Catan).**\n\n---\n\n## 3. SETUP (5 minutes)\n\n1. **Place the board** centrally. Set the **GTA Marker at +0.8\u00b0C** (representing roughly present-day warming above pre-industrial baseline).\n2. **Each player** takes a Region Board and sets Economy to 5, Wellbeing to 5, Resilience to 0. Place 3 black Emissions Cubes on each region (starting local emissions).\n3. **Shuffle** the Decade Cards and stack them face-down in order (Decade 1 on top through Decade 10).\n4. **Shuffle** the Action Card deck. Deal 5 Action Cards to each player.\n5. **Place 6 Sink Tokens** on the board's Carbon Sink zones (forests, oceans, soil).\n6. **Seal the 3 Tipping Point Envelopes** and place them face-down on the marked GTA thresholds: **+1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C**. (Players know *where* they trigger but not *what* they contain.)\n7. **Fill the Delay Track** with 0 cubes in all 3 slots (clean start).\n8. Give each player **4 Resource Tokens** to start.\n\n---\n\n## 4. TURN STRUCTURE (Each Round = 1 Decade, ~4 minutes)\n\nEach round has **5 phases** executed in order:\n\n### Phase 1 \u2014 DECADE REVEAL (30 sec)\nFlip the top Decade Card. Read aloud. It specifies:\n- **Base Emissions**: number of black cubes added to the Emissions Pool (represents global background emissions from sectors players don't directly control).\n- **Event**: a global event (e.g., \"Extreme drought \u2014 all players lose 1 Wellbeing unless they have \u22653 Resilience\" or \"Technological breakthrough \u2014 Mitigate cards cost 1 fewer Resource this round\").\n- **Delayed Consequence Check**: instruction to resolve any Delay Track effects (see Phase 5).\n\n### Phase 2 \u2014 PLAYER ACTIONS (2 min, simultaneous with brief negotiation)\nEach player, in clockwise order, takes **2 actions** chosen from:\n\n| Action | Cost | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Play a Mitigate Card** | 1\u20133 Resources | Remove emissions cubes from your region or the Emissions Pool; some add Sink Tokens |\n| **Play an Adapt Card** | 1\u20132 Resources | Gain Resilience points; protect against future Decade Card penalties |\n| **Play a Develop Card** | 0\u20131 Resources | Gain Economy and Resources but **add** 1\u20132 Emissions Cubes to your region |\n| **Play a Cooperate Card** | Varies | Joint action with another willing player; stronger effects (e.g., \"Both players remove 3 cubes total and gain 1 Resilience each\") but requires mutual consent and shared cost |\n| **Harvest Resources** | Free action | Gain Resources equal to half your Economy (rounded up). No card played. |\n\nPlayers may briefly negotiate (30-second timer encouraged) before locking in actions. Trading 1 Resource between players is allowed once per round.\n\n### Phase 3 \u2014 EMISSIONS RESOLUTION (1 min)\n1. Count **total new Emissions Cubes** generated this round (from Decade Card base + all player regions' standing emissions + any Development cards played).\n2. Subtract cubes absorbed by **Sink Tokens** (each Sink Token absorbs 1 cube per round).\n3. Place **net new cubes** into the **Delay Track Slot 1** (the newest slot).\n\n### Phase 4 \u2014 WARMING & FEEDBACK (30 sec)\n1. Move cubes from **Delay Track Slot 3** (the oldest) into the central Emissions Pool. For every **5 cubes** in the Emissions Pool, increase GTA by **+0.1\u00b0C**. (Cubes remain in the pool; warming is cumulative.)\n2. Shift Delay Track: Slot 2 \u2192 Slot 3, Slot 1 \u2192 Slot 2. (This means emissions take **3 rounds/decades to fully manifest** as temperature rise.)\n3. **Roll both Uncertainty Dice**. Apply the net result to GTA. (This represents climate variability and model uncertainty \u2014 sometimes you get lucky, often you don't.)\n4. **Check Feedback Loop triggers** (see Core Mechanics).\n5. **Check Tipping Point thresholds** (see Core Mechanics).\n\n### Phase 5 \u2014 UPKEEP (30 sec)\n1. Each player draws 2 Action Cards (hand limit: 7; discard excess).\n2. Each player gains Resources equal to half their Economy (rounded up).\n3. If any player's Wellbeing = 0, they enter **Crisis**: they can only take 1 action next round and cannot play Cooperate cards.\n4. Advance the Round Marker.\n\n---\n\n## 5. CORE MECHANICS\n\n### A. The Delay Track (Delayed Consequences)\nThis is the game's signature teaching mechanic. Emissions generated now don't raise temperature for **3 rounds**. This means:\n- Early \"Develop heavy\" strategies feel painless at first \u2014 the temperature doesn't budge.\n- By rounds 5\u20137, players experience the accumulated warming from their early decisions and often feel trapped.\n- **Design intent**: Players viscerally learn that climate change has *committed warming* \u2014 what you emit today locks in consequences decades later, and by the time you see the thermometer move, it's too late to undo it.\n\n### B. Feedback Loop Tiles\nTwelve tiles are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. When GTA crosses a **0.3\u00b0C increment** (1.1, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0), draw a Feedback Loop Tile and place it on the board. Examples:\n\n| Tile | Type | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Permafrost Thaw** | Reinforcing | +1 Emissions Cube added automatically every round from now on |\n| **Ice-Albedo Loss** | Reinforcing | Uncertainty Dice results of 0 now count as +0.1\u00b0C |\n| **Vegetation Greening** | Balancing | +1 Sink Token added to the board |\n| **Ocean Heat Uptake** | Balancing (temporary) | Absorb 2 extra cubes per round for 3 rounds, then flip to \"Ocean Acidification\" \u2014 lose 1 Sink Token permanently |\n| **Water Vapor Amplification** | Reinforcing | Each +0.1\u00b0C rise now adds 1 extra cube to the Emissions Pool |\n| **Cloud Feedback \u2014 Unknown** | Wild | Roll 1 Uncertainty Die: on +0.2, reinforcing (+1 cube/round); on \u20130.1, balancing (+1 Sink); otherwise no effect. Represents genuine scientific uncertainty. |\n\n**Design intent**: Players learn that the climate system responds to warming with its own dynamics \u2014 some make things worse, some help temporarily, and some are genuinely uncertain. The system is not linear.\n\n### C. Tipping Point Envelopes (Nonlinear Tipping Risk) \u2605\nThis is the **required nonlinear tipping mechanic**. Three sealed envelopes sit on the board at +1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C. When GTA reaches or passes a threshold, the corresponding envelope is **opened and read aloud**. Effects are **irreversible for the rest of the game**.\n\nEnvelope contents (unknown to players until opened):\n\n- **+1.3\u00b0C \u2014 Arctic Sea Ice Collapse**: Remove 2 Sink Tokens permanently. All future Uncertainty Dice results shift +0.1\u00b0C (place a reminder token on each die). *The system has lost a buffer.*\n- **+1.6\u00b0C \u2014 Amazon Dieback**: Remove 2 more Sink Tokens. Add 2 Emissions Cubes to the pool immediately (stored carbon release). All Adapt cards now cost +1 Resource (adaptation is harder in a degraded world). *A carbon sink has become a carbon source.*\n- **+1.9\u00b0C \u2014 West Antarctic Ice Sheet Destabilization**: All players immediately lose 2 Wellbeing (sea level rise impacts). For the rest of the game, every Decade Card event that causes Wellbeing loss causes **double** the loss. *The damage accelerates and compounds.*\n\n**Why envelopes?** The sealed format creates genuine uncertainty and dread. Players know *something* bad happens at each threshold but not exactly what, mirroring how scientists understand tipping points \u2014 we know the approximate thresholds and that consequences are severe, but precise impacts carry deep uncertainty. The irreversibility teaches that some changes cannot be walked back.\n\n**Nonlinearity**: Note that each envelope makes subsequent envelopes *more likely to be triggered* (fewer sinks, shifted dice, compounding emissions). This is the hallmark of nonlinear risk \u2014 crossing one threshold makes the next one closer, creating potential cascade.\n\n### D. Mitigation vs. Adaptation Tradeoff\n- **Mitigate cards** reduce emissions (address the cause) but provide no immediate protection against Decade Card events. They're an investment in the collective future.\n- **Adapt cards** increase Resilience (protect against symptoms) but do nothing to slow warming. They're an investment in individual survival.\n- **Resource scarcity** forces genuine tradeoffs: you cannot do everything. A player who only mitigates may have low Resilience and get hammered by events. A player who only adapts free-rides on others' mitigation \u2014 but if everyone adapts and nobody mitigates, the planet warms and everyone loses.\n- **Develop cards** offer short-term economic gain (more Resources) at the cost of more emissions \u2014 the fossil-fuel development trap.\n\n### E. Cooperative Pressure with Competitive Tension\n- **Shared loss condition** (GTA \u2265 2.0\u00b0C) means players must cooperate on mitigation.\n- **Individual Resilience Scores** mean players compete for distinction *within* the cooperative frame.\n- **Cooperate cards** are the most efficient actions in the game but require mutual consent and trust \u2014 modeling international climate negotiation dynamics.\n- **No hidden roles or asymmetric powers** \u2014 all players have the same card pool and starting position, satisfying the constraint. Differentiation emerges from strategic choices, not assigned advantages.\n\n---\n\n## 6. WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS\n\n### Collective Loss (Everyone Loses)\n- **GTA reaches +2.0\u00b0C at the end of any Phase 4.** The planet has crossed into dangerous warming. All players lose regardless of individual scores.\n- **3 or more players simultaneously in Crisis** (Wellbeing = 0). Societal collapse. All players lose.\n\n### Collective Survival + Individual Distinction\nIf players complete all **10 rounds** with GTA below +2.0\u00b0C:\n- **All players win** (the planet survives).\n- The player with the **highest Resilience Score** is recognized as the most future-ready leader.\n- **Tiebreaker**: highest Wellbeing, then highest Economy.\n\n### Difficulty Scaling\n- **Standard**: Start at +0.8\u00b0C, 6 Sink Tokens, 4 starting Resources.\n- **Hard**: Start at +1.0\u00b0C, 5 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources.\n- **Nightmare**: Start at +1.1\u00b0C, 4 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources, and the +1.3\u00b0C envelope is opened immediately at setup.\n\n---\n\n## 7. SAMPLE ROUND (Round 3 of a 4-player game)\n\n**Current state**: GTA = +1.0\u00b0C. Delay Track: Slot 1 = 4 cubes, Slot 2 = 6 cubes, Slot 3 = 3 cubes. Emissions Pool = 8 cubes. Sink Tokens = 5. No Feedback Tiles or Tipping Envelopes triggered yet.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Decade Reveal**\nDecade Card 3 is flipped: *\"Rapid industrialization in emerging economies. Base Emissions: 6 cubes. Event: All players with Economy \u2265 7 gain +1 Resource but add 1 Emissions Cube to their region. Delayed Consequence: Resolve Delay Track Slot 3.\"*\n\nPlayer C has Economy 7 \u2014 she gains 1 Resource but must add 1 cube to her region.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Player Actions**\n- **Player A** plays a **Mitigate Card** (\"Renewable Energy Transition\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources, remove 3 cubes from the Emissions Pool) and **Harvests Resources** (Economy 5 \u2192 gains 3 Resources).\n- **Player B** plays a **Develop Card** (\"Industrial Expansion\" \u2014 cost 0, gain +2 Economy, add 2 Emissions Cubes to his region) and plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Flood Barriers\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 2 Resilience).\n- **Player C** plays a **Cooperate Card** with Player D (\"Joint Carbon Capture Initiative\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources split between them, remove 4 cubes from the Emissions Pool and add 1 Sink Token). Player D agrees and they split the cost 1/1.\n- **Player D** (second action) plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Drought-Resistant Agriculture\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 1 Resilience and +1 Wellbeing).\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 Emissions Resolution**\n- New cubes this round: 6 (Decade base) + 3+3+4+3 (standing regional emissions from each player, Player B's went up by 2 from Development) + 1 (Player C's event cube) = **20 cubes generated**.\n- Wait \u2014 let me recalculate standing regional emissions. Each player started with 3. Player B added 2 from Develop, so Player B has 5. Player A removed some from the pool but her regional emissions are still 3. So regional totals: A=3, B=5, C=4 (3+1 event), D=3. Total regional = 15. Plus 6 base = **21 cubes generated**.\n- Sink absorption: 5 Sink Tokens + 1 new from Cooper",

They must coordinate mitigation and adaptation under uncertainty and **time delays**, while avoiding **nonlinear tipping risks** and political/economic instability. Cooperative success is shared, but players also track \u201cpublic trust\u201d for light competitive tension.\n\n---\n\n# (1) Game Objective\n**Collective objective:**  \nKeep global warming, impacts, and social instability below failure thresholds through a mix of **mitigation** (reducing emissions and removing carbon) and **adaptation** (reducing damages), while managing **uncertainty** and **delayed consequences**.\n\n**Individual objective (minor tension):**  \nEach player earns **Trust** for helping the world *and* supporting their coalition\u2019s priorities. If the group wins, the highest Trust is \u201cmost effective leader.\u201d If the group loses, everyone loses.\n\nDesign intent: This keeps incentives aligned (no pay-to-win asymmetry), while still creating negotiation pressure.\n\n---\n\n# (2) Components List\n**Board & tracks**\n- 1 World Board with tracks:\n  - **Temperature (\u00b0C)**: 0.0 \u2192 3.5 (loss at 3.0+ unless variant)\n  - **Atmospheric CO\u2082 stock** (a \u201cbathtub\u201d track)\n  - **Annual Emissions** (flow track)\n  - **Impact/Damage** (0\u201312)\n  - **Public Stability** (0\u201310)\n  - **Adaptation Level** (0\u20136)\n  - **Research/Capacity** (0\u20136)\n- **Tipping Meter** (0\u201310) with marked thresholds at 4, 7, 9\n\n**Cards & tokens**\n- 90+ **Policy cards** (Mitigation, Adaptation, Mixed, Research/Governance)\n- 40 **Event cards** (storms, droughts, geopolitical shocks, innovation breakthroughs, etc.)\n- 18 **Uncertainty tokens** (face-down \u201c+ / \u2013 / neutral\u201d modifiers revealed later)\n- 25 **Carbon tokens** (CO\u2082 stock)\n- 20 **Emission tokens** (annual flow)\n- 20 **Damage tokens**\n- 15 **Stability tokens**\n- 12 **Adaptation tokens**\n- 12 **Research tokens**\n- 10 **Tipping tokens** (or a single marker)\n\n**Player materials**\n- 5 identical **Coalition boards** (same resources/actions; different \u201cpriority scoring\u201d only)\n- 5 pawns (for turn order)\n- Trust tokens (or score track) and 5 reference sheets\n\n**Dice**\n- 1 six-sided die (used only when uncertainty triggers; optional but speeds play)\n\n---\n\n# (3) Setup (8\u201310 minutes first time, 5 minutes later)\n1. Place the World Board. Set starting values (recommended):\n   - Temperature: **1.2\u00b0C**\n   - CO\u2082 Stock: **6**\n   - Annual Emissions: **6**\n   - Impact/Damage: **2**\n   - Stability: **7**\n   - Adaptation: **1**\n   - Research: **1**\n   - Tipping Meter: **2**\n2. Shuffle **Policy deck**; reveal **3 Policy cards** to a public \u201cCouncil Row.\u201d\n3. Shuffle **Event deck**; place it face down.\n4. Give each player:\n   - 1 Coalition board (all functionally identical)\n   - **3 Action cubes** (used to pay for actions each round)\n   - **2 Trust** (starting)\n5. Place **Uncertainty tokens** face down as a supply.\n6. Decide game length: **7 rounds** (target 40\u201345 minutes). Use 6 rounds for 35 minutes; 8 rounds for 50 minutes.\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn Structure (Each Round)\nEach round represents ~5 years and has **five phases**:\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast (Uncertainty is seeded, not resolved)\n- Reveal the top **Event card**, but place it in \u201cForecast\u201d (it will hit later).\n- Draw **1 Uncertainty token** and place it on the Event face down.\n\n> Teaches: we know *something* is coming, but magnitude/sign may be uncertain.\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning (negotiation & commitments)\n- Players discuss and may make nonbinding plans.\n- Optional: players may \u201cpledge\u201d a card they intend to buy this round (no penalty if they break it; it\u2019s about social dynamics).\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Action (players take turns spending 3 action cubes)\nOn your turn, spend action cubes to do any combination:\n- **Buy a Policy** from Council Row (cost shown) and resolve it.\n- **Fund Research/Capacity** (+Research)\n- **Build Adaptation** (+Adaptation)\n- **Implement Mitigation** (reduce Annual Emissions, sometimes adds CO\u2082 removal)\n- **Emergency Response** (reduce immediate Damage but may reduce Stability)\n- **Pass/Support**: spend 1 cube to add +1 \u201cSupport\u201d to another player\u2019s purchase (simulates coalition building; earns Trust if the policy succeeds).\n\nAfter each purchase, **refill Council Row to 3**.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 System Update (delayed consequences)\nResolve in order:\n1. **Emissions \u2192 CO\u2082 stock:** add Annual Emissions to CO\u2082 stock (capped by track).\n2. **CO\u2082 stock \u2192 Temperature:** temperature rises if CO\u2082 stock above a threshold (nonlinear steps; see mechanics).\n3. **Temperature \u2192 Damage:** add Damage depending on Temperature and Events.\n4. **Adaptation reduces Damage:** subtract Adaptation (but not below 0); adaptation doesn\u2019t stop temperature.\n5. **Stability check:** if Damage increased a lot this round, Stability may fall.\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Event Resolution (with lag)\n- Now resolve the Event that was **Forecast two rounds ago** (events have built-in delay).\n- Reveal its Uncertainty token and apply the modified effect.\n\n> Teaches: action now affects outcomes later; events and impacts don\u2019t arrive instantly.\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core Mechanics (What teaches climate science through play)\n\n## A. Stock-and-flow \u201cbathtub\u201d model (CO\u2082 and emissions)\n- **Annual Emissions** are a flow; **CO\u2082 Stock** accumulates.\n- Many mitigation policies reduce Annual Emissions, but **temperature keeps rising** until CO\u2082 stabilizes and later declines.\n- Some cards provide **Carbon Removal**, subtracting directly from CO\u2082 Stock (often expensive or slow).\n\n**Why it teaches:** players feel the lag\u2014cutting emissions doesn\u2019t instantly cool the system.\n\n---\n\n## B. Mitigation vs Adaptation tradeoff (and political economy)\n- **Mitigation cards** lower future temperature trajectory but can cost Stability or short-term resources.\n- **Adaptation** reduces near-term Damage but:\n  - has diminishing returns past level 4,\n  - does not reduce Temperature,\n  - can crowd out mitigation if overused.\n\n**Why it teaches:** adaptation is necessary but not sufficient; mitigation has delayed benefits.\n\n---\n\n## C. Feedback loops (reinforcing and balancing)\nThe board includes two built-in feedback rules:\n\n1) **Damage \u2192 Stability feedback (reinforcing):**  \nIf Damage increases by **3+** in a single round, reduce Stability by **1**.  \nIf Stability \u2264 3, all policy costs increase by +1 (harder to govern), increasing risk of further damage.\n\n2) **Research \u2192 Policy efficiency (balancing):**  \nFor every 2 Research, the first mitigation policy each round gains +1 extra emissions reduction (or +1 carbon removal on certain cards).  \nThis encourages investment and makes decarbonization easier later.\n\n**Why it teaches:** compounding crises can spiral; capacity-building can bend the curve.\n\n---\n\n## D. Uncertainty without randomness dominating decisions\nEvents are known in type (storm, drought, innovation, political shock) **two rounds before** they land, but the **uncertainty token** alters magnitude (or occasionally flips sign for \u201cinnovation/policy backlash\u201d events).\n\n- Uncertainty tokens are: **+2, +1, 0, \u20131, \u20132** (distribution weighted toward small values).\n- Players can invest in **Monitoring/Science** to peek at or reroll uncertainty tokens.\n\n**Why it teaches:** uncertainty is managed via information and robustness, not ignored.\n\n---\n\n## E. Nonlinear tipping risk mechanic (explicit requirement)\n### **Tipping Meter + Threshold Check**\n- Certain conditions add **Tipping tokens**, e.g.:\n  - Temperature crosses 1.5\u00b0C: +1\n  - Temperature crosses 2.0\u00b0C: +2\n  - CO\u2082 Stock high for 2 consecutive rounds: +1\n  - Large Damage spike (\u22654): +1\n- At end of each round, if Tipping Meter \u2265 **4**, **7**, or **9**, draw a **Tipping card** (or resolve a tiered effect table).  \nThese effects are **nonlinear**: small extra warming can suddenly cause big persistent changes.\n\nExample Tipping effects:\n- **Ice-Albedo Shift (Tier 1):** permanent +1 Temperature step every other round unless CO\u2082 stock is reduced below a safe threshold.\n- **Permafrost Pulse (Tier 2):** add +3 CO\u2082 stock immediately and +1 emissions for 2 rounds.\n- **Circulation Disruption (Tier 3):** adaptation effectiveness reduced by 2 permanently; events become harsher.\n\n**Design caution:** tipping effects can feel punishing; keep early tiers mild and give players off-ramps (expensive but possible) to reduce the meter.\n\n---\n\n# (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n**Group Win:** At the end of the final round (7), all are true:\n- Temperature < **2.0\u00b0C** (or \u22642.0 for easier mode)\n- Damage \u2264 **8**\n- Stability \u2265 **4**\n- Tipping Meter < **7** (i.e., avoided high-tier tipping cascade)\n\n**Immediate Group Loss (any time):**\n- Temperature \u2265 **3.0\u00b0C**, OR\n- Damage \u2265 **12**, OR\n- Stability reaches **0**, OR\n- Tipping Meter reaches **10** (runaway tipping)\n\n**Individual \u201csoft win\u201d (only if group wins):**\n- Most Trust wins \u201cCoalition Leadership.\u201d (Tie: shared.)\n\n---\n\n# (7) Sample Round (Round 3 of 7)\n**Start state (end of Round 2):**  \nTemp 1.4\u00b0C, CO\u2082 8, Emissions 6, Damage 3, Stability 6, Adaptation 2, Research 2, Tipping 3.\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast\nReveal Event: **\u201cMega-Drought (delayed)\u201d**: \u201cIn 2 rounds, add Damage = Temperature level + modifier.\u201d  \nPlace a face-down Uncertainty token on it.\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning\nPlayers debate: cut emissions now or build adaptation to absorb drought impacts? They see drought coming but not severity.\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Action\nEach has 3 cubes.\n\n- Player A buys **Renewables Push**: cost 2 cubes, reduces Emissions \u20132, Stability \u20131 (short-term backlash).  \n- Player B funds **Monitoring Network**: cost 1, +1 Research; and uses 1 cube to **peek** at the drought uncertainty token (it\u2019s **+1**). They warn the group drought will be worse.  \n- Player C buys **Urban Heat Adaptation**: cost 2, +2 Adaptation (max 6).  \n- Player D uses **Support** action to help Player E afford **Industrial Efficiency** (Emissions \u20131, plus future synergy).\n\nCouncil Row refills as purchases occur.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 System Update\n1) Emissions \u2192 CO\u2082: Emissions now 3 (6 \u20132 \u20131). Add 3 to CO\u2082: CO\u2082 becomes 11.  \n2) CO\u2082 \u2192 Temp: Board rule: at CO\u2082 11, Temp increases by +0.2 \u2192 **1.6\u00b0C**.  \n3) Temp \u2192 Damage: at 1.6\u00b0C add +2 Damage \u2192 Damage becomes 5.  \n4) Adaptation reduces Damage: Adaptation is now 4 (2 +2), reduce Damage by 2 \u2192 Damage becomes 3.  \n5) Stability check: Damage didn\u2019t spike by 3+, but Stability already dropped by 1 from Renewables Push \u2192 Stability 5.\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Event Resolution\nResolve the Event forecasted in Round 1: **\u201cCoastal Flooding\u201d** with uncertainty revealed (**\u20131**).  \nBase flood damage is 3; modifier \u20131 \u2192 +2 Damage. Adaptation reduces by 2 (but not below 0) \u2192 net +0 to Damage.  \nTipping Meter: crossing 1.5\u00b0C added +1 earlier this round, now Tipping becomes **4** \u2192 triggers Tier 1 tipping: draw **Ice-Albedo Shift** (mild persistent risk).\n\nPlayers feel: despite emissions cuts, CO\u2082 stock rose (still positive flow), temp rose, and a tipping threshold was crossed\u2014classic delayed consequence.\n\n---\n\n# (8) Teacher/Facilitator Debrief Guide (10 minutes)\n## What to observe during play (facilitator notes)\n- Do players confuse **emissions** with **CO\u2082 stock**? (Common misconception)\n- Do they over-invest in adaptation because it \u201cworks now,\u201d under-investing in mitigation?\n- Do they treat uncertainty as \u201canything can happen\u201d or as bounded and manageable?\n- When tipping appears, do they shift to risk management or panic spending?\n\n## Quick debrief structure\n1) **Reconstruct the timeline:** \u201cWhat did you do in Rounds 1\u20132 that mattered in Round 4?\u201d  \n2) **Identify the feedback loops:** \u201cWhat spiraled? What stabilized?\u201d  \n3) **Tradeoffs under uncertainty:** \u201cWhat was robust vs. optimized?\u201d\n\n## Three discussion prompts (use these verbatim)\n1) **Stock vs flow & delay:**  \n   \u201cWe reduced emissions, but temperature still rose. What part of the system stored \u2018past emissions,\u2019 and how did that change your decisions?\u201d\n\n2) **Mitigation vs adaptation under political constraints:**  \n   \u201cWhich decisions reduced future risk versus reduced today\u2019s damage? When did adaptation feel like the \u2018right\u2019 move, and when did it become a trap?\u201d\n\n3) **Nonlinear tipping risk & uncertainty:**  \n   \u201cWhen the tipping meter crossed a threshold, did your strategy change? How is that similar to real-world climate risk management where probabilities and impacts are uncertain but potentially catastrophic?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Self-critical design notes / risk management\n- **Risk: tipping feels arbitrary or punitive.** Mitigation: make tipping thresholds visible, provide early warning, and include at least one costly \u201ctipping reversal\u201d policy so players have agency.\n- **Risk: dominant strategy (e.g., pure adaptation).** Mitigation: ensure adaptation has diminishing returns and cannot prevent temperature-driven tipping accumulation.\n- **Risk: quarterbacking in cooperative play.** Mitigation: limit table talk during Action phase (optional rule), or require simultaneous planning with revealed choices.\n\nIf you want, I can provide: a starter set of 20 example Policy cards and 12 Event cards with exact numbers tuned for 7-round balance, plus an \u201ceasy classroom mode\u201d that finishes in 35 minutes.",

      "text": "Of course. Here is a detailed design for a tabletop board game, \"Terra Nova: A Climate Futures Game,\" that meets your specifications.\n\n### **Terra Nova: A Climate Futures Game**\n\n**Game Summary:** Players represent distinct global societies from the present day to the year 2070. You must develop your society to be resilient and prosperous, but your actions contribute to rising global temperatures and CO2 levels. You win or lose collectively based on the planet's health, but the player who builds the most resilient society is recognized as the lead steward for the future.\n\n---\n\n### **(1) Game Objective**\n\nThe primary objective is **collective survival**. All players must work together to keep the Global Stress Track from reaching the \"Irreversible Collapse\" space by the end of Round 7.\n\nThe secondary objective is **individual achievement**. If the players win collectively, the player with the highest individual **Resilience Score** is declared the \"Lead Steward\" and wins the game. This creates a cooperative environment with a light competitive edge, forcing players to balance personal gain against the common good.\n\n---\n\n### **(2) Components List**\n\n*   **1 Game Board:** Features a round tracker (1-7), a \"Global Stress\" track (0-20), and a central \"Atmosphere\" space. The Stress track has marked thresholds for Feedback Loops and Tipping Point Rolls.\n*   **5 Player Mats:** Each mat tracks a player's individual **Resilience Score** (0-50) and their per-round generation of two resources: **Capital** and **Research**.\n*   **60 Project Cards:** The core action cards. 20 of each type:\n    *   **Mitigation (Green):** Projects that reduce CO2. (e.g., \"Global Reforestation,\" \"Carbon Capture Network\").\n    *   **Adaptation (Blue):** Projects that increase a player's Resilience Score. (e.g., \"Coastal Sea Walls,\" \"Drought-Resistant Agriculture\").\n    *   **Development (Gray):** Projects that increase a player's Capital or Research generation but add Carbon Cubes to the Atmosphere. (e.g., \"Industrial Expansion,\" \"Data Centers\").\n*   **25 Event Cards:** Drawn each round, these introduce uncertainty and challenges. (e.g., \"Record Wildfires,\" \"Unexpected Volcanic Eruption,\" \"Scientific Breakthrough\").\n*   **10 Tipping Point Cards:** A high-stakes deck of devastating, game-altering events. (e.g., \"Permafrost Methane Release,\" \"Atlantic Overturning Circulation Collapse\").\n*   **80 Resource Tokens:** 40x Capital (yellow coins), 40x Research (blue beakers).\n*   **50 Carbon Cubes (Black):** Represent tons of CO2 equivalent.\n*   **Track Markers:** 1x Round Marker, 1x Global Stress Marker, 5x Player Score Markers.\n*   **1 Tipping Point Die (D8):** A standard eight-sided die used to represent nonlinear risk.\n\n---\n\n### **(3) Setup**\n\n1.  **Board:** Place the game board in the center. Set the Round Marker on '1' and the Global Stress Marker on '3'.\n2.  **Players:** Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding Player Mat and Score Marker. Place your Score Marker on '5' on your Resilience track.\n3.  **Decks:** Shuffle the Project, Event, and Tipping Point decks separately and place them face down near the board.\n4.  **Resources:** Place the Capital, Research, and Carbon Cube pools in a general supply.\n5.  **Starting Hand:** Each player receives 5 starting Capital, 3 Research, and draws a starting hand of 5 Project Cards.\n\n---\n\n### **(4) Turn Structure (A Round)**\n\nEach round represents approximately one decade and consists of four phases:\n\n1.  **Event Phase:** Draw and resolve the top card of the Event Deck. This immediately affects all players or the game state, setting the stage for the round.\n2.  **Action Phase:** Starting with the player with the lowest Resilience Score and proceeding clockwise, each player takes one turn. On your turn, you must perform **one** of the following actions:\n    *   **Play a Project Card:** Pay its Capital/Research cost, place it in your play area, and resolve its effects (gain Resilience, add/remove Carbon, increase resource generation).\n    *   **Innovate:** Pay 3 Research to discard up to three Project Cards from your hand and draw that many new ones.\n    *   **Fundraise:** Gain 3 Capital.\n3.  **Consequence Phase:** This phase is resolved in a strict order, representing the delayed impact of actions.\n    *   **a. Tally Emissions:** Count all Carbon Cubes generated by players' Development projects this round and place them in the \"Atmosphere\" space on the board.\n    *   **b. Update Stress:** For every 2 Carbon Cubes in the Atmosphere, move the Global Stress Marker up by 1 space. (e.g., 5 cubes = move up 2 spaces). Remove the cubes from the board.\n    *   **c. Trigger Feedback Loops:** Check the Global Stress track. If the marker is on or has passed a \"Feedback Loop\" threshold, its effect is now active for the rest of the game (e.g., \"Threshold 10: Permafrost Melt - Add 1 extra Carbon Cube to the Atmosphere during each Consequence Phase\").\n    *   **d. Check for Tipping Point:** Check the Global Stress track. If the marker is on or has passed a \"Tipping Point Roll\" threshold, the player who just raised the Stress level must roll the D8 Tipping Point Die.\n        *   *Stress 12-15:* A roll of **1** triggers a Tipping Point.\n        *   *Stress 16-19:* A roll of **1 or 2** triggers a Tipping Point.\n        *   If triggered, draw and resolve a Tipping Point Card. These are powerful and permanent negative effects.\n4.  **Resolution Phase:**\n    *   **a. Generate Resources:** Each player collects Capital and Research as indicated on their Player Mat and any active Development cards.\n    *   **b. Draw Cards:** Each player draws 2 Project Cards. The hand limit is 7.\n    *   **c. Advance Round:** Move the Round Marker to the next space. The player with the highest Resilience Score becomes the first player for the next round's Action Phase.\n\n---\n\n### **(5) Core Mechanics Explained**\n\n*   **Mitigation vs. Adaptation Tradeoffs:** Players have limited actions and resources. Do you play a **Mitigation** card to remove Carbon, helping everyone by keeping Global Stress low but not improving your own score? Or do you play an **Adaptation** card to increase your Resilience Score, getting you closer to winning but doing nothing about the root problem? This is the game's central strategic tension.\n*   **Delayed Consequences:** Actions taken in the Action Phase (e.g., building a \"Factory\") don't have an immediate impact on the climate. The Carbon is only tallied and converted to Global Stress in the",

They must collectively keep the **Global Temperature Anomaly (GTA)** below **+2.0\u00b0C** over 10 rounds (decades) while individually developing their region's **Resilience Score**. The game ends in shared defeat if GTA hits +2.0\u00b0C or higher, but among survivors, the player with the highest Resilience Score earns distinction as the most future-ready leader. This creates a cooperative backbone with light competitive tension: you need each other to survive, but individual strategy still matters.\n\n---\n\n## 2. COMPONENTS LIST\n\n| Component | Qty | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Game Board | 1 | Central planet map with GTA track (0.0\u20132.5\u00b0C in 0.1\u00b0 increments), Emissions Pool, Carbon Sink zones, and 5 region slots |\n| Region Boards | 5 | Individual player dashboards tracking Economy (0\u201310), Wellbeing (0\u201310), Resilience (0\u201315), and local Emissions output |\n| GTA Marker | 1 | Red wooden token on the temperature track |\n| Emissions Cubes (black) | 80 | Represent CO\u2082-equivalent units entering the Emissions Pool |\n| Sink Tokens (green) | 30 | Represent natural/engineered carbon absorption capacity |\n| Decade Cards | 10 | One drawn per round; set global events, base emissions, and reveal delayed consequences from prior choices |\n| Action Cards | 60 | Four types: **Mitigate** (blue), **Adapt** (orange), **Develop** (grey), **Cooperate** (gold) |\n| Feedback Loop Tiles | 12 | Placed on the board when triggered; some amplify warming (reinforcing), some dampen it (balancing) |\n| Tipping Point Envelope | 3 | Sealed envelopes opened at secret GTA thresholds; contain irreversible system shifts |\n| Uncertainty Dice | 2 | Custom d6: faces show \u20130.1\u00b0C, 0, 0, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.2\u00b0C (skewed toward warming to reflect scientific probability distributions) |\n| Delay Track | 1 | A 3-slot queue on the board where current-round emissions sit before affecting GTA (representing ocean/atmospheric lag) |\n| Resource Tokens (yellow) | 60 | Currency for playing Action Cards |\n| Score Pad & Reference Cards | 5+1 | Quick-reference for turn structure and card effects |\n\n**Total estimated component cost for production prototype: moderate (comparable to Pandemic or Catan).**\n\n---\n\n## 3. SETUP (5 minutes)\n\n1. **Place the board** centrally. Set the **GTA Marker at +0.8\u00b0C** (representing roughly present-day warming above pre-industrial baseline).\n2. **Each player** takes a Region Board and sets Economy to 5, Wellbeing to 5, Resilience to 0. Place 3 black Emissions Cubes on each region (starting local emissions).\n3. **Shuffle** the Decade Cards and stack them face-down in order (Decade 1 on top through Decade 10).\n4. **Shuffle** the Action Card deck. Deal 5 Action Cards to each player.\n5. **Place 6 Sink Tokens** on the board's Carbon Sink zones (forests, oceans, soil).\n6. **Seal the 3 Tipping Point Envelopes** and place them face-down on the marked GTA thresholds: **+1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C**. (Players know *where* they trigger but not *what* they contain.)\n7. **Fill the Delay Track** with 0 cubes in all 3 slots (clean start).\n8. Give each player **4 Resource Tokens** to start.\n\n---\n\n## 4. TURN STRUCTURE (Each Round = 1 Decade, ~4 minutes)\n\nEach round has **5 phases** executed in order:\n\n### Phase 1 \u2014 DECADE REVEAL (30 sec)\nFlip the top Decade Card. Read aloud. It specifies:\n- **Base Emissions**: number of black cubes added to the Emissions Pool (represents global background emissions from sectors players don't directly control).\n- **Event**: a global event (e.g., \"Extreme drought \u2014 all players lose 1 Wellbeing unless they have \u22653 Resilience\" or \"Technological breakthrough \u2014 Mitigate cards cost 1 fewer Resource this round\").\n- **Delayed Consequence Check**: instruction to resolve any Delay Track effects (see Phase 5).\n\n### Phase 2 \u2014 PLAYER ACTIONS (2 min, simultaneous with brief negotiation)\nEach player, in clockwise order, takes **2 actions** chosen from:\n\n| Action | Cost | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Play a Mitigate Card** | 1\u20133 Resources | Remove emissions cubes from your region or the Emissions Pool; some add Sink Tokens |\n| **Play an Adapt Card** | 1\u20132 Resources | Gain Resilience points; protect against future Decade Card penalties |\n| **Play a Develop Card** | 0\u20131 Resources | Gain Economy and Resources but **add** 1\u20132 Emissions Cubes to your region |\n| **Play a Cooperate Card** | Varies | Joint action with another willing player; stronger effects (e.g., \"Both players remove 3 cubes total and gain 1 Resilience each\") but requires mutual consent and shared cost |\n| **Harvest Resources** | Free action | Gain Resources equal to half your Economy (rounded up). No card played. |\n\nPlayers may briefly negotiate (30-second timer encouraged) before locking in actions. Trading 1 Resource between players is allowed once per round.\n\n### Phase 3 \u2014 EMISSIONS RESOLUTION (1 min)\n1. Count **total new Emissions Cubes** generated this round (from Decade Card base + all player regions' standing emissions + any Development cards played).\n2. Subtract cubes absorbed by **Sink Tokens** (each Sink Token absorbs 1 cube per round).\n3. Place **net new cubes** into the **Delay Track Slot 1** (the newest slot).\n\n### Phase 4 \u2014 WARMING & FEEDBACK (30 sec)\n1. Move cubes from **Delay Track Slot 3** (the oldest) into the central Emissions Pool. For every **5 cubes** in the Emissions Pool, increase GTA by **+0.1\u00b0C**. (Cubes remain in the pool; warming is cumulative.)\n2. Shift Delay Track: Slot 2 \u2192 Slot 3, Slot 1 \u2192 Slot 2. (This means emissions take **3 rounds/decades to fully manifest** as temperature rise.)\n3. **Roll both Uncertainty Dice**. Apply the net result to GTA. (This represents climate variability and model uncertainty \u2014 sometimes you get lucky, often you don't.)\n4. **Check Feedback Loop triggers** (see Core Mechanics).\n5. **Check Tipping Point thresholds** (see Core Mechanics).\n\n### Phase 5 \u2014 UPKEEP (30 sec)\n1. Each player draws 2 Action Cards (hand limit: 7; discard excess).\n2. Each player gains Resources equal to half their Economy (rounded up).\n3. If any player's Wellbeing = 0, they enter **Crisis**: they can only take 1 action next round and cannot play Cooperate cards.\n4. Advance the Round Marker.\n\n---\n\n## 5. CORE MECHANICS\n\n### A. The Delay Track (Delayed Consequences)\nThis is the game's signature teaching mechanic. Emissions generated now don't raise temperature for **3 rounds**. This means:\n- Early \"Develop heavy\" strategies feel painless at first \u2014 the temperature doesn't budge.\n- By rounds 5\u20137, players experience the accumulated warming from their early decisions and often feel trapped.\n- **Design intent**: Players viscerally learn that climate change has *committed warming* \u2014 what you emit today locks in consequences decades later, and by the time you see the thermometer move, it's too late to undo it.\n\n### B. Feedback Loop Tiles\nTwelve tiles are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. When GTA crosses a **0.3\u00b0C increment** (1.1, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0), draw a Feedback Loop Tile and place it on the board. Examples:\n\n| Tile | Type | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Permafrost Thaw** | Reinforcing | +1 Emissions Cube added automatically every round from now on |\n| **Ice-Albedo Loss** | Reinforcing | Uncertainty Dice results of 0 now count as +0.1\u00b0C |\n| **Vegetation Greening** | Balancing | +1 Sink Token added to the board |\n| **Ocean Heat Uptake** | Balancing (temporary) | Absorb 2 extra cubes per round for 3 rounds, then flip to \"Ocean Acidification\" \u2014 lose 1 Sink Token permanently |\n| **Water Vapor Amplification** | Reinforcing | Each +0.1\u00b0C rise now adds 1 extra cube to the Emissions Pool |\n| **Cloud Feedback \u2014 Unknown** | Wild | Roll 1 Uncertainty Die: on +0.2, reinforcing (+1 cube/round); on \u20130.1, balancing (+1 Sink); otherwise no effect. Represents genuine scientific uncertainty. |\n\n**Design intent**: Players learn that the climate system responds to warming with its own dynamics \u2014 some make things worse, some help temporarily, and some are genuinely uncertain. The system is not linear.\n\n### C. Tipping Point Envelopes (Nonlinear Tipping Risk) \u2605\nThis is the **required nonlinear tipping mechanic**. Three sealed envelopes sit on the board at +1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C. When GTA reaches or passes a threshold, the corresponding envelope is **opened and read aloud**. Effects are **irreversible for the rest of the game**.\n\nEnvelope contents (unknown to players until opened):\n\n- **+1.3\u00b0C \u2014 Arctic Sea Ice Collapse**: Remove 2 Sink Tokens permanently. All future Uncertainty Dice results shift +0.1\u00b0C (place a reminder token on each die). *The system has lost a buffer.*\n- **+1.6\u00b0C \u2014 Amazon Dieback**: Remove 2 more Sink Tokens. Add 2 Emissions Cubes to the pool immediately (stored carbon release). All Adapt cards now cost +1 Resource (adaptation is harder in a degraded world). *A carbon sink has become a carbon source.*\n- **+1.9\u00b0C \u2014 West Antarctic Ice Sheet Destabilization**: All players immediately lose 2 Wellbeing (sea level rise impacts). For the rest of the game, every Decade Card event that causes Wellbeing loss causes **double** the loss. *The damage accelerates and compounds.*\n\n**Why envelopes?** The sealed format creates genuine uncertainty and dread. Players know *something* bad happens at each threshold but not exactly what, mirroring how scientists understand tipping points \u2014 we know the approximate thresholds and that consequences are severe, but precise impacts carry deep uncertainty. The irreversibility teaches that some changes cannot be walked back.\n\n**Nonlinearity**: Note that each envelope makes subsequent envelopes *more likely to be triggered* (fewer sinks, shifted dice, compounding emissions). This is the hallmark of nonlinear risk \u2014 crossing one threshold makes the next one closer, creating potential cascade.\n\n### D. Mitigation vs. Adaptation Tradeoff\n- **Mitigate cards** reduce emissions (address the cause) but provide no immediate protection against Decade Card events. They're an investment in the collective future.\n- **Adapt cards** increase Resilience (protect against symptoms) but do nothing to slow warming. They're an investment in individual survival.\n- **Resource scarcity** forces genuine tradeoffs: you cannot do everything. A player who only mitigates may have low Resilience and get hammered by events. A player who only adapts free-rides on others' mitigation \u2014 but if everyone adapts and nobody mitigates, the planet warms and everyone loses.\n- **Develop cards** offer short-term economic gain (more Resources) at the cost of more emissions \u2014 the fossil-fuel development trap.\n\n### E. Cooperative Pressure with Competitive Tension\n- **Shared loss condition** (GTA \u2265 2.0\u00b0C) means players must cooperate on mitigation.\n- **Individual Resilience Scores** mean players compete for distinction *within* the cooperative frame.\n- **Cooperate cards** are the most efficient actions in the game but require mutual consent and trust \u2014 modeling international climate negotiation dynamics.\n- **No hidden roles or asymmetric powers** \u2014 all players have the same card pool and starting position, satisfying the constraint. Differentiation emerges from strategic choices, not assigned advantages.\n\n---\n\n## 6. WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS\n\n### Collective Loss (Everyone Loses)\n- **GTA reaches +2.0\u00b0C at the end of any Phase 4.** The planet has crossed into dangerous warming. All players lose regardless of individual scores.\n- **3 or more players simultaneously in Crisis** (Wellbeing = 0). Societal collapse. All players lose.\n\n### Collective Survival + Individual Distinction\nIf players complete all **10 rounds** with GTA below +2.0\u00b0C:\n- **All players win** (the planet survives).\n- The player with the **highest Resilience Score** is recognized as the most future-ready leader.\n- **Tiebreaker**: highest Wellbeing, then highest Economy.\n\n### Difficulty Scaling\n- **Standard**: Start at +0.8\u00b0C, 6 Sink Tokens, 4 starting Resources.\n- **Hard**: Start at +1.0\u00b0C, 5 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources.\n- **Nightmare**: Start at +1.1\u00b0C, 4 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources, and the +1.3\u00b0C envelope is opened immediately at setup.\n\n---\n\n## 7. SAMPLE ROUND (Round 3 of a 4-player game)\n\n**Current state**: GTA = +1.0\u00b0C. Delay Track: Slot 1 = 4 cubes, Slot 2 = 6 cubes, Slot 3 = 3 cubes. Emissions Pool = 8 cubes. Sink Tokens = 5. No Feedback Tiles or Tipping Envelopes triggered yet.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Decade Reveal**\nDecade Card 3 is flipped: *\"Rapid industrialization in emerging economies. Base Emissions: 6 cubes. Event: All players with Economy \u2265 7 gain +1 Resource but add 1 Emissions Cube to their region. Delayed Consequence: Resolve Delay Track Slot 3.\"*\n\nPlayer C has Economy 7 \u2014 she gains 1 Resource but must add 1 cube to her region.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Player Actions**\n- **Player A** plays a **Mitigate Card** (\"Renewable Energy Transition\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources, remove 3 cubes from the Emissions Pool) and **Harvests Resources** (Economy 5 \u2192 gains 3 Resources).\n- **Player B** plays a **Develop Card** (\"Industrial Expansion\" \u2014 cost 0, gain +2 Economy, add 2 Emissions Cubes to his region) and plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Flood Barriers\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 2 Resilience).\n- **Player C** plays a **Cooperate Card** with Player D (\"Joint Carbon Capture Initiative\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources split between them, remove 4 cubes from the Emissions Pool and add 1 Sink Token). Player D agrees and they split the cost 1/1.\n- **Player D** (second action) plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Drought-Resistant Agriculture\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 1 Resilience and +1 Wellbeing).\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 Emissions Resolution**\n- New cubes this round: 6 (Decade base) + 3+3+4+3 (standing regional emissions from each player, Player B's went up by 2 from Development) + 1 (Player C's event cube) = **20 cubes generated**.\n- Wait \u2014 let me recalculate standing regional emissions. Each player started with 3. Player B added 2 from Develop, so Player B has 5. Player A removed some from the pool but her regional emissions are still 3. So regional totals: A=3, B=5, C=4 (3+1 event), D=3. Total regional = 15. Plus 6 base = **21 cubes generated**.\n- Sink absorption: 5 Sink Tokens + 1 new from Cooper",

They must collectively keep the **Global Temperature Anomaly (GTA)** below **+2.0\u00b0C** over 10 rounds (decades) while individually developing their region's **Resilience Score**. The game ends in shared defeat if GTA hits +2.0\u00b0C or higher, but among survivors, the player with the highest Resilience Score earns distinction as the most future-ready leader. This creates a cooperative backbone with light competitive tension: you need each other to survive, but individual strategy still matters.\n\n---\n\n## 2. COMPONENTS LIST\n\n| Component | Qty | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Game Board | 1 | Central planet map with GTA track (0.0\u20132.5\u00b0C in 0.1\u00b0 increments), Emissions Pool, Carbon Sink zones, and 5 region slots |\n| Region Boards | 5 | Individual player dashboards tracking Economy (0\u201310), Wellbeing (0\u201310), Resilience (0\u201315), and local Emissions output |\n| GTA Marker | 1 | Red wooden token on the temperature track |\n| Emissions Cubes (black) | 80 | Represent CO\u2082-equivalent units entering the Emissions Pool |\n| Sink Tokens (green) | 30 | Represent natural/engineered carbon absorption capacity |\n| Decade Cards | 10 | One drawn per round; set global events, base emissions, and reveal delayed consequences from prior choices |\n| Action Cards | 60 | Four types: **Mitigate** (blue), **Adapt** (orange), **Develop** (grey), **Cooperate** (gold) |\n| Feedback Loop Tiles | 12 | Placed on the board when triggered; some amplify warming (reinforcing), some dampen it (balancing) |\n| Tipping Point Envelope | 3 | Sealed envelopes opened at secret GTA thresholds; contain irreversible system shifts |\n| Uncertainty Dice | 2 | Custom d6: faces show \u20130.1\u00b0C, 0, 0, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.2\u00b0C (skewed toward warming to reflect scientific probability distributions) |\n| Delay Track | 1 | A 3-slot queue on the board where current-round emissions sit before affecting GTA (representing ocean/atmospheric lag) |\n| Resource Tokens (yellow) | 60 | Currency for playing Action Cards |\n| Score Pad & Reference Cards | 5+1 | Quick-reference for turn structure and card effects |\n\n**Total estimated component cost for production prototype: moderate (comparable to Pandemic or Catan).**\n\n---\n\n## 3. SETUP (5 minutes)\n\n1. **Place the board** centrally. Set the **GTA Marker at +0.8\u00b0C** (representing roughly present-day warming above pre-industrial baseline).\n2. **Each player** takes a Region Board and sets Economy to 5, Wellbeing to 5, Resilience to 0. Place 3 black Emissions Cubes on each region (starting local emissions).\n3. **Shuffle** the Decade Cards and stack them face-down in order (Decade 1 on top through Decade 10).\n4. **Shuffle** the Action Card deck. Deal 5 Action Cards to each player.\n5. **Place 6 Sink Tokens** on the board's Carbon Sink zones (forests, oceans, soil).\n6. **Seal the 3 Tipping Point Envelopes** and place them face-down on the marked GTA thresholds: **+1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C**. (Players know *where* they trigger but not *what* they contain.)\n7. **Fill the Delay Track** with 0 cubes in all 3 slots (clean start).\n8. Give each player **4 Resource Tokens** to start.\n\n---\n\n## 4. TURN STRUCTURE (Each Round = 1 Decade, ~4 minutes)\n\nEach round has **5 phases** executed in order:\n\n### Phase 1 \u2014 DECADE REVEAL (30 sec)\nFlip the top Decade Card. Read aloud. It specifies:\n- **Base Emissions**: number of black cubes added to the Emissions Pool (represents global background emissions from sectors players don't directly control).\n- **Event**: a global event (e.g., \"Extreme drought \u2014 all players lose 1 Wellbeing unless they have \u22653 Resilience\" or \"Technological breakthrough \u2014 Mitigate cards cost 1 fewer Resource this round\").\n- **Delayed Consequence Check**: instruction to resolve any Delay Track effects (see Phase 5).\n\n### Phase 2 \u2014 PLAYER ACTIONS (2 min, simultaneous with brief negotiation)\nEach player, in clockwise order, takes **2 actions** chosen from:\n\n| Action | Cost | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Play a Mitigate Card** | 1\u20133 Resources | Remove emissions cubes from your region or the Emissions Pool; some add Sink Tokens |\n| **Play an Adapt Card** | 1\u20132 Resources | Gain Resilience points; protect against future Decade Card penalties |\n| **Play a Develop Card** | 0\u20131 Resources | Gain Economy and Resources but **add** 1\u20132 Emissions Cubes to your region |\n| **Play a Cooperate Card** | Varies | Joint action with another willing player; stronger effects (e.g., \"Both players remove 3 cubes total and gain 1 Resilience each\") but requires mutual consent and shared cost |\n| **Harvest Resources** | Free action | Gain Resources equal to half your Economy (rounded up). No card played. |\n\nPlayers may briefly negotiate (30-second timer encouraged) before locking in actions. Trading 1 Resource between players is allowed once per round.\n\n### Phase 3 \u2014 EMISSIONS RESOLUTION (1 min)\n1. Count **total new Emissions Cubes** generated this round (from Decade Card base + all player regions' standing emissions + any Development cards played).\n2. Subtract cubes absorbed by **Sink Tokens** (each Sink Token absorbs 1 cube per round).\n3. Place **net new cubes** into the **Delay Track Slot 1** (the newest slot).\n\n### Phase 4 \u2014 WARMING & FEEDBACK (30 sec)\n1. Move cubes from **Delay Track Slot 3** (the oldest) into the central Emissions Pool. For every **5 cubes** in the Emissions Pool, increase GTA by **+0.1\u00b0C**. (Cubes remain in the pool; warming is cumulative.)\n2. Shift Delay Track: Slot 2 \u2192 Slot 3, Slot 1 \u2192 Slot 2. (This means emissions take **3 rounds/decades to fully manifest** as temperature rise.)\n3. **Roll both Uncertainty Dice**. Apply the net result to GTA. (This represents climate variability and model uncertainty \u2014 sometimes you get lucky, often you don't.)\n4. **Check Feedback Loop triggers** (see Core Mechanics).\n5. **Check Tipping Point thresholds** (see Core Mechanics).\n\n### Phase 5 \u2014 UPKEEP (30 sec)\n1. Each player draws 2 Action Cards (hand limit: 7; discard excess).\n2. Each player gains Resources equal to half their Economy (rounded up).\n3. If any player's Wellbeing = 0, they enter **Crisis**: they can only take 1 action next round and cannot play Cooperate cards.\n4. Advance the Round Marker.\n\n---\n\n## 5. CORE MECHANICS\n\n### A. The Delay Track (Delayed Consequences)\nThis is the game's signature teaching mechanic. Emissions generated now don't raise temperature for **3 rounds**. This means:\n- Early \"Develop heavy\" strategies feel painless at first \u2014 the temperature doesn't budge.\n- By rounds 5\u20137, players experience the accumulated warming from their early decisions and often feel trapped.\n- **Design intent**: Players viscerally learn that climate change has *committed warming* \u2014 what you emit today locks in consequences decades later, and by the time you see the thermometer move, it's too late to undo it.\n\n### B. Feedback Loop Tiles\nTwelve tiles are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. When GTA crosses a **0.3\u00b0C increment** (1.1, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0), draw a Feedback Loop Tile and place it on the board. Examples:\n\n| Tile | Type | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Permafrost Thaw** | Reinforcing | +1 Emissions Cube added automatically every round from now on |\n| **Ice-Albedo Loss** | Reinforcing | Uncertainty Dice results of 0 now count as +0.1\u00b0C |\n| **Vegetation Greening** | Balancing | +1 Sink Token added to the board |\n| **Ocean Heat Uptake** | Balancing (temporary) | Absorb 2 extra cubes per round for 3 rounds, then flip to \"Ocean Acidification\" \u2014 lose 1 Sink Token permanently |\n| **Water Vapor Amplification** | Reinforcing | Each +0.1\u00b0C rise now adds 1 extra cube to the Emissions Pool |\n| **Cloud Feedback \u2014 Unknown** | Wild | Roll 1 Uncertainty Die: on +0.2, reinforcing (+1 cube/round); on \u20130.1, balancing (+1 Sink); otherwise no effect. Represents genuine scientific uncertainty. |\n\n**Design intent**: Players learn that the climate system responds to warming with its own dynamics \u2014 some make things worse, some help temporarily, and some are genuinely uncertain. The system is not linear.\n\n### C. Tipping Point Envelopes (Nonlinear Tipping Risk) \u2605\nThis is the **required nonlinear tipping mechanic**. Three sealed envelopes sit on the board at +1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C. When GTA reaches or passes a threshold, the corresponding envelope is **opened and read aloud**. Effects are **irreversible for the rest of the game**.\n\nEnvelope contents (unknown to players until opened):\n\n- **+1.3\u00b0C \u2014 Arctic Sea Ice Collapse**: Remove 2 Sink Tokens permanently. All future Uncertainty Dice results shift +0.1\u00b0C (place a reminder token on each die). *The system has lost a buffer.*\n- **+1.6\u00b0C \u2014 Amazon Dieback**: Remove 2 more Sink Tokens. Add 2 Emissions Cubes to the pool immediately (stored carbon release). All Adapt cards now cost +1 Resource (adaptation is harder in a degraded world). *A carbon sink has become a carbon source.*\n- **+1.9\u00b0C \u2014 West Antarctic Ice Sheet Destabilization**: All players immediately lose 2 Wellbeing (sea level rise impacts). For the rest of the game, every Decade Card event that causes Wellbeing loss causes **double** the loss. *The damage accelerates and compounds.*\n\n**Why envelopes?** The sealed format creates genuine uncertainty and dread. Players know *something* bad happens at each threshold but not exactly what, mirroring how scientists understand tipping points \u2014 we know the approximate thresholds and that consequences are severe, but precise impacts carry deep uncertainty. The irreversibility teaches that some changes cannot be walked back.\n\n**Nonlinearity**: Note that each envelope makes subsequent envelopes *more likely to be triggered* (fewer sinks, shifted dice, compounding emissions). This is the hallmark of nonlinear risk \u2014 crossing one threshold makes the next one closer, creating potential cascade.\n\n### D. Mitigation vs. Adaptation Tradeoff\n- **Mitigate cards** reduce emissions (address the cause) but provide no immediate protection against Decade Card events. They're an investment in the collective future.\n- **Adapt cards** increase Resilience (protect against symptoms) but do nothing to slow warming. They're an investment in individual survival.\n- **Resource scarcity** forces genuine tradeoffs: you cannot do everything. A player who only mitigates may have low Resilience and get hammered by events. A player who only adapts free-rides on others' mitigation \u2014 but if everyone adapts and nobody mitigates, the planet warms and everyone loses.\n- **Develop cards** offer short-term economic gain (more Resources) at the cost of more emissions \u2014 the fossil-fuel development trap.\n\n### E. Cooperative Pressure with Competitive Tension\n- **Shared loss condition** (GTA \u2265 2.0\u00b0C) means players must cooperate on mitigation.\n- **Individual Resilience Scores** mean players compete for distinction *within* the cooperative frame.\n- **Cooperate cards** are the most efficient actions in the game but require mutual consent and trust \u2014 modeling international climate negotiation dynamics.\n- **No hidden roles or asymmetric powers** \u2014 all players have the same card pool and starting position, satisfying the constraint. Differentiation emerges from strategic choices, not assigned advantages.\n\n---\n\n## 6. WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS\n\n### Collective Loss (Everyone Loses)\n- **GTA reaches +2.0\u00b0C at the end of any Phase 4.** The planet has crossed into dangerous warming. All players lose regardless of individual scores.\n- **3 or more players simultaneously in Crisis** (Wellbeing = 0). Societal collapse. All players lose.\n\n### Collective Survival + Individual Distinction\nIf players complete all **10 rounds** with GTA below +2.0\u00b0C:\n- **All players win** (the planet survives).\n- The player with the **highest Resilience Score** is recognized as the most future-ready leader.\n- **Tiebreaker**: highest Wellbeing, then highest Economy.\n\n### Difficulty Scaling\n- **Standard**: Start at +0.8\u00b0C, 6 Sink Tokens, 4 starting Resources.\n- **Hard**: Start at +1.0\u00b0C, 5 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources.\n- **Nightmare**: Start at +1.1\u00b0C, 4 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources, and the +1.3\u00b0C envelope is opened immediately at setup.\n\n---\n\n## 7. SAMPLE ROUND (Round 3 of a 4-player game)\n\n**Current state**: GTA = +1.0\u00b0C. Delay Track: Slot 1 = 4 cubes, Slot 2 = 6 cubes, Slot 3 = 3 cubes. Emissions Pool = 8 cubes. Sink Tokens = 5. No Feedback Tiles or Tipping Envelopes triggered yet.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Decade Reveal**\nDecade Card 3 is flipped: *\"Rapid industrialization in emerging economies. Base Emissions: 6 cubes.

Delayed Consequence: Resolve Delay Track Slot 3.\"*\n\nPlayer C has Economy 7 \u2014 she gains 1 Resource but must add 1 cube to her region.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Player Actions**\n- **Player A** plays a **Mitigate Card** (\"Renewable Energy Transition\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources, remove 3 cubes from the Emissions Pool) and **Harvests Resources** (Economy 5 \u2192 gains 3 Resources).\n- **Player B** plays a **Develop Card** (\"Industrial Expansion\" \u2014 cost 0, gain +2 Economy, add 2 Emissions Cubes to his region) and plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Flood Barriers\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 2 Resilience).\n- **Player C** plays a **Cooperate Card** with Player D (\"Joint Carbon Capture Initiative\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources split between them, remove 4 cubes from the Emissions Pool and add 1 Sink Token). Player D agrees and they split the cost 1/1.\n- **Player D** (second action) plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Drought-Resistant Agriculture\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 1 Resilience and +1 Wellbeing).\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 Emissions Resolution**\n- New cubes this round: 6 (Decade base) + 3+3+4+3 (standing regional emissions from each player, Player B's went up by 2 from Development) + 1 (Player C's event cube) = **20 cubes generated**.\n- Wait \u2014 let me recalculate standing regional emissions. Each player started with 3. Player B added 2 from Develop, so Player B has 5. Player A removed some from the pool but her regional emissions are still 3. So regional totals: A=3, B=5, C=4 (3+1 event), D=3. Total regional = 15. Plus 6 base = **21 cubes generated**.\n- Sink absorption: 5 Sink Tokens + 1 new from Cooper"

Place the World Board. Set starting values (recommended):\n   - Temperature: **1.2\u00b0C**\n   - CO\u2082 Stock: **6**\n   - Annual Emissions: **6**\n   - Impact/Damage: **2**\n   - Stability: **7**\n   - Adaptation: **1**\n   - Research: **1**\n   - Tipping Meter: **2**\n2. Shuffle **Policy deck**; reveal **3 Policy cards** to a public \u201cCouncil Row.\u201d\n3. Shuffle **Event deck**; place it face down.\n4. Give each player:\n   - 1 Coalition board (all functionally identical)\n   - **3 Action cubes** (used to pay for actions each round)\n   - **2 Trust** (starting)\n5. Place **Uncertainty tokens** face down as a supply.\n6. Decide game length: **7 rounds** (target 40\u201345 minutes). Use 6 rounds for 35 minutes; 8 rounds for 50 minutes.\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn Structure (Each Round)\nEach round represents ~5 years and has **five phases**:\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast (Uncertainty is seeded, not resolved)\n- Reveal the top **Event card**, but place it in \u201cForecast\u201d (it will hit later).\n- Draw **1 Uncertainty token** and place it on the Event face down.\n\n> Teaches: we know *something* is coming, but magnitude/sign may be uncertain.\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning (negotiation & commitments)\n- Players discuss and may make nonbinding plans.\n- Optional: players may \u201cpledge\u201d a card they intend to buy this round (no penalty if they break it; it\u2019s about social dynamics).\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Action (players take turns spending 3 action cubes)\nOn your turn, spend action cubes to do any combination:\n- **Buy a Policy** from Council Row (cost shown) and resolve it.\n- **Fund Research/Capacity** (+Research)\n- **Build Adaptation** (+Adaptation)\n- **Implement Mitigation** (reduce Annual Emissions, sometimes adds CO\u2082 removal)\n- **Emergency Response** (reduce immediate Damage but may reduce Stability)\n- **Pass/Support**: spend 1 cube to add +1 \u201cSupport\u201d to another player\u2019s purchase (simulates coalition building; earns Trust if the policy succeeds).\n\nAfter each purchase, **refill Council Row to 3**.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 System Update (delayed consequences)\nResolve in order:\n1. **Emissions \u2192 CO\u2082 stock:** add Annual Emissions to CO\u2082 stock (capped by track).\n2. **CO\u2082 stock \u2192 Temperature:** temperature rises if CO\u2082 stock above a threshold (nonlinear steps; see mechanics).\n3. **Temperature \u2192 Damage:** add Damage depending on Temperature and Events.\n4. **Adaptation reduces Damage:** subtract Adaptation (but not below 0); adaptation doesn\u2019t stop temperature.\n5. **Stability check:** if Damage increased a lot this round, Stability may fall.\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Event Resolution (with lag)\n- Now resolve the Event that was **Forecast two rounds ago** (events have built-in delay).\n- Reveal its Uncertainty token and apply the modified effect.\n\n> Teaches: action now affects outcomes later; events and impacts don\u2019t arrive instantly.\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core Mechanics (What teaches climate science through play)\n\n## A. Stock-and-flow \u201cbathtub\u201d model (CO\u2082 and emissions)\n- **Annual Emissions** are a flow; **CO\u2082 Stock** accumulates.\n- Many mitigation policies reduce Annual Emissions, but **temperature keeps rising** until CO\u2082 stabilizes and later declines.\n- Some cards provide **Carbon Removal**, subtracting directly from CO\u2082 Stock (often expensive or slow).\n\n**Why it teaches:** players feel the lag\u2014cutting emissions doesn\u2019t instantly cool the system.\n\n---\n\n## B. Mitigation vs Adaptation tradeoff (and political economy)\n- **Mitigation cards** lower future temperature trajectory but can cost Stability or short-term resources.\n- **Adaptation** reduces near-term Damage but:\n  - has diminishing returns past level 4,\n  - does not reduce Temperature,\n  - can crowd out mitigation if overused.\n\n**Why it teaches:** adaptation is necessary but not sufficient; mitigation has delayed benefits.\n\n---\n\n## C. Feedback loops (reinforcing and balancing)\nThe board includes two built-in feedback rules:\n\n1) **Damage \u2192 Stability feedback (reinforcing):**  \nIf Damage increases by **3+** in a single round, reduce Stability by **1**.  \nIf Stability \u2264 3, all policy costs increase by +1 (harder to govern), increasing risk of further damage.\n\n2) **Research \u2192 Policy efficiency (balancing):**  \nFor every 2 Research, the first mitigation policy each round gains +1 extra emissions reduction (or +1 carbon removal on certain cards).  \nThis encourages investment and makes decarbonization easier later.\n\n**Why it teaches:** compounding crises can spiral; capacity-building can bend the curve.\n\n---\n\n## D. Uncertainty without randomness dominating decisions\nEvents are known in type (storm, drought, innovation, political shock) **two rounds before** they land, but the **uncertainty token** alters magnitude (or occasionally flips sign for \u201cinnovation/policy backlash\u201d events).\n\n- Uncertainty tokens are: **+2, +1, 0, \u20131, \u20132** (distribution weighted toward small values).\n- Players can invest in **Monitoring/Science** to peek at or reroll uncertainty tokens.\n\n**Why it teaches:** uncertainty is managed via information and robustness, not ignored.\n\n---\n\n## E. Nonlinear tipping risk mechanic (explicit requirement)\n### **Tipping Meter + Threshold Check**\n- Certain conditions add **Tipping tokens**, e.g.:\n  - Temperature crosses 1.5\u00b0C: +1\n  - Temperature crosses 2.0\u00b0C: +2\n  - CO\u2082 Stock high for 2 consecutive rounds: +1\n  - Large Damage spike (\u22654): +1\n- At end of each round, if Tipping Meter \u2265 **4**, **7**, or **9**, draw a **Tipping card** (or resolve a tiered effect table).  \nThese effects are **nonlinear**: small extra warming can suddenly cause big persistent changes.\n\nExample Tipping effects:\n- **Ice-Albedo Shift (Tier 1):** permanent +1 Temperature step every other round unless CO\u2082 stock is reduced below a safe threshold.\n- **Permafrost Pulse (Tier 2):** add +3 CO\u2082 stock immediately and +1 emissions for 2 rounds.\n- **Circulation Disruption (Tier 3):** adaptation effectiveness reduced by 2 permanently; events become harsher.\n\n**Design caution:** tipping effects can feel punishing; keep early tiers mild and give players off-ramps (expensive but possible) to reduce the meter.\n\n---\n\n# (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n**Group Win:** At the end of the final round (7), all are true:\n- Temperature < **2.0\u00b0C** (or \u22642.0 for easier mode)\n- Damage \u2264 **8**\n- Stability \u2265 **4**\n- Tipping Meter < **7** (i.e., avoided high-tier tipping cascade)\n\n**Immediate Group Loss (any time):**\n- Temperature \u2265 **3.0\u00b0C**, OR\n- Damage \u2265 **12**, OR\n- Stability reaches **0**, OR\n- Tipping Meter reaches **10** (runaway tipping)\n\n**Individual \u201csoft win\u201d (only if group wins):**\n- Most Trust wins \u201cCoalition Leadership.\u201d (Tie: shared.)\n\n---\n\n# (7) Sample Round (Round 3 of 7)\n**Start state (end of Round 2):**  \nTemp 1.4\u00b0C, CO\u2082 8, Emissions 6, Damage 3, Stability 6, Adaptation 2, Research 2, Tipping 3.\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast\nReveal Event: **\u201cMega-Drought (delayed)\u201d**: \u201cIn 2 rounds, add Damage = Temperature level + modifier.\u201d  \nPlace a face-down Uncertainty token on it.\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning\nPlayers debate: cut emissions now or build adaptation to absorb drought impacts? They see drought coming but not severity.\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Action\nEach has 3 cubes.\n\n- Player A buys **Renewables Push**: cost 2 cubes, reduces Emissions \u20132, Stability \u20131 (short-term backlash).  \n- Player B funds **Monitoring Network**: cost 1, +1 Research; and uses 1 cube to **peek** at the drought uncertainty token (it\u2019s **+1**). They warn the group drought will be worse.  \n- Player C buys **Urban Heat Adaptation**: cost 2, +2 Adaptation (max 6).  \n- Player D uses **Support** action to help Player E afford **Industrial Efficiency** (Emissions \u20131, plus future synergy).\n\nCouncil Row refills as purchases occur.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 System Update\n1) Emissions \u2192 CO\u2082: Emissions now 3 (6 \u20132 \u20131). Add 3 to CO\u2082: CO\u2082 becomes 11.  \n2) CO\u2082 \u2192 Temp: Board rule: at CO\u2082 11, Temp increases by +0.2 \u2192 **1.6\u00b0C**.  \n3) Temp \u2192 Damage: at 1.6\u00b0C add +2 Damage \u2192 Damage becomes 5.  \n4) Adaptation reduces Damage: Adaptation is now 4 (2 +2), reduce Damage by 2 \u2192 Damage becomes 3.  \n5) Stability check: Damage didn\u2019t spike by 3+, but Stability already dropped by 1 from Renewables Push \u2192 Stability 5.\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Event Resolution\nResolve the Event forecasted in Round 1: **\u201cCoastal Flooding\u201d** with uncertainty revealed (**\u20131**).  \nBase flood damage is 3; modifier \u20131 \u2192 +2 Damage. Adaptation reduces by 2 (but not below 0) \u2192 net +0 to Damage.  \nTipping Meter: crossing 1.5\u00b0C added +1 earlier this round, now Tipping becomes **4** \u2192 triggers Tier 1 tipping: draw **Ice-Albedo Shift** (mild persistent risk).\n\nPlayers feel: despite emissions cuts, CO\u2082 stock rose (still positive flow), temp rose, and a tipping threshold was crossed\u2014classic delayed consequence.\n\n---\n\n# (8) Teacher/Facilitator Debrief Guide (10 minutes)\n## What to observe during play (facilitator notes)\n- Do players confuse **emissions** with **CO\u2082 stock**? (Common misconception)\n- Do they over-invest in adaptation because it \u201cworks now,\u201d under-investing in mitigation?\n- Do they treat uncertainty as \u201canything can happen\u201d or as bounded and manageable?\n- When tipping appears, do they shift to risk management or panic spending?\n\n## Quick debrief structure\n1) **Reconstruct the timeline:** \u201cWhat did you do in Rounds 1\u20132 that mattered in Round 4?\u201d  \n2) **Identify the feedback loops:** \u201cWhat spiraled? What stabilized?\u201d  \n3) **Tradeoffs under uncertainty:** \u201cWhat was robust vs. optimized?\u201d\n\n## Three discussion prompts (use these verbatim)\n1) **Stock vs flow & delay:**  \n   \u201cWe reduced emissions, but temperature still rose. What part of the system stored \u2018past emissions,\u2019 and how did that change your decisions?\u201d\n\n2) **Mitigation vs adaptation under political constraints:**  \n   \u201cWhich decisions reduced future risk versus reduced today\u2019s damage? When did adaptation feel like the \u2018right\u2019 move, and when did it become a trap?\u201d\n\n3) **Nonlinear tipping risk & uncertainty:**  \n   \u201cWhen the tipping meter crossed a threshold, did your strategy change? How is that similar to real-world climate risk management where probabilities and impacts are uncertain but potentially catastrophic?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Self-critical design notes / risk management\n- **Risk: tipping feels arbitrary or punitive.** Mitigation: make tipping thresholds visible, provide early warning, and include at least one costly \u201ctipping reversal\u201d policy so players have agency.\n- **Risk: dominant strategy (e.g., pure adaptation).** Mitigation: ensure adaptation has diminishing returns and cannot prevent temperature-driven tipping accumulation.\n- **Risk: quarterbacking in cooperative play.** Mitigation: limit table talk during Action phase (optional rule), or require simultaneous planning with revealed choices.\n\nIf you want, I can provide: a starter set of 20 example Policy cards and 12 Event cards with exact numbers tuned for 7-round balance, plus an \u201ceasy classroom mode\u201d that finishes in 35 minutes."

          "text": "Of course. Here is a detailed design for a tabletop board game, \"Terra Nova: A Climate Futures Game,\" that meets your specifications.\n\n### **Terra Nova: A Climate Futures Game**\n\n**Game Summary:** Players represent distinct global societies from the present day to the year 2070. You must develop your society to be resilient and prosperous, but your actions contribute to rising global temperatures and CO2 levels. You win or lose collectively based on the planet's health, but the player who builds the most resilient society is recognized as the lead steward for the future.\n\n---\n\n### **(1) Game Objective**\n\nThe primary objective is **collective survival**. All players must work together to keep the Global Stress Track from reaching the \"Irreversible Collapse\" space by the end of Round 7.\n\nThe secondary objective is **individual achievement**. If the players win collectively, the player with the highest individual **Resilience Score** is declared the \"Lead Steward\" and wins the game. This creates a cooperative environment with a light competitive edge, forcing players to balance personal gain against the common good.\n\n---\n\n### **(2) Components List**\n\n*   **1 Game Board:** Features a round tracker (1-7), a \"Global Stress\" track (0-20), and a central \"Atmosphere\" space. The Stress track has marked thresholds for Feedback Loops and Tipping Point Rolls.\n*   **5 Player Mats:** Each mat tracks a player's individual **Resilience Score** (0-50) and their per-round generation of two resources: **Capital** and **Research**.\n*   **60 Project Cards:** The core action cards. 20 of each type:\n    *   **Mitigation (Green):** Projects that reduce CO2. (e.g., \"Global Reforestation,\" \"Carbon Capture Network\").\n    *   **Adaptation (Blue):** Projects that increase a player's Resilience Score. (e.g., \"Coastal Sea Walls,\" \"Drought-Resistant Agriculture\").\n    *   **Development (Gray):** Projects that increase a player's Capital or Research generation but add Carbon Cubes to the Atmosphere. (e.g., \"Industrial Expansion,\" \"Data Centers\").\n*   **25 Event Cards:** Drawn each round, these introduce uncertainty and challenges. (e.g., \"Record Wildfires,\" \"Unexpected Volcanic Eruption,\" \"Scientific Breakthrough\").\n*   **10 Tipping Point Cards:** A high-stakes deck of devastating, game-altering events. (e.g., \"Permafrost Methane Release,\" \"Atlantic Overturning Circulation Collapse\").\n*   **80 Resource Tokens:** 40x Capital (yellow coins), 40x Research (blue beakers).\n*   **50 Carbon Cubes (Black):** Represent tons of CO2 equivalent.\n*   **Track Markers:** 1x Round Marker, 1x Global Stress Marker, 5x Player Score Markers.\n*   **1 Tipping Point Die (D8):** A standard eight-sided die used to represent nonlinear risk.\n\n---\n\n### **(3) Setup**\n\n1.  **Board:** Place the game board in the center. Set the Round Marker on '1' and the Global Stress Marker on '3'.\n2.  **Players:** Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding Player Mat and Score Marker. Place your Score Marker on '5' on your Resilience track.\n3.  **Decks:** Shuffle the Project, Event, and Tipping Point decks separately and place them face down near the board.\n4.  **Resources:** Place the Capital, Research, and Carbon Cube pools in a general supply.\n5.  **Starting Hand:** Each player receives 5 starting Capital, 3 Research, and draws a starting hand of 5 Project Cards.\n\n---\n\n### **(4) Turn Structure (A Round)**\n\nEach round represents approximately one decade and consists of four phases:\n\n1.  **Event Phase:** Draw and resolve the top card of the Event Deck. This immediately affects all players or the game state, setting the stage for the round.\n2.  **Action Phase:** Starting with the player with the lowest Resilience Score and proceeding clockwise, each player takes one turn. On your turn, you must perform **one** of the following actions:\n    *   **Play a Project Card:** Pay its Capital/Research cost, place it in your play area, and resolve its effects (gain Resilience, add/remove Carbon, increase resource generation).\n    *   **Innovate:** Pay 3 Research to discard up to three Project Cards from your hand and draw that many new ones.\n    *   **Fundraise:** Gain 3 Capital.\n3.  **Consequence Phase:** This phase is resolved in a strict order, representing the delayed impact of actions.\n    *   **a. Tally Emissions:** Count all Carbon Cubes generated by players' Development projects this round and place them in the \"Atmosphere\" space on the board.\n    *   **b. Update Stress:** For every 2 Carbon Cubes in the Atmosphere, move the Global Stress Marker up by 1 space. (e.g., 5 cubes = move up 2 spaces). Remove the cubes from the board.\n    *   **c. Trigger Feedback Loops:** Check the Global Stress track. If the marker is on or has passed a \"Feedback Loop\" threshold, its effect is now active for the rest of the game (e.g., \"Threshold 10: Permafrost Melt - Add 1 extra Carbon Cube to the Atmosphere during each Consequence Phase\").\n    *   **d. Check for Tipping Point:** Check the Global Stress track. If the marker is on or has passed a \"Tipping Point Roll\" threshold, the player who just raised the Stress level must roll the D8 Tipping Point Die.\n        *   *Stress 12-15:* A roll of **1** triggers a Tipping Point.\n        *   *Stress 16-19:* A roll of **1 or 2** triggers a Tipping Point.\n        *   If triggered, draw and resolve a Tipping Point Card. These are powerful and permanent negative effects.\n4.  **Resolution Phase:**\n    *   **a. Generate Resources:** Each player collects Capital and Research as indicated on their Player Mat and any active Development cards.\n    *   **b. Draw Cards:** Each player draws 2 Project Cards. The hand limit is 7.\n    *   **c. Advance Round:** Move the Round Marker to the next space. The player with the highest Resilience Score becomes the first player for the next round's Action Phase.\n\n---\n\n### **(5) Core Mechanics Explained**\n\n*   **Mitigation vs. Adaptation Tradeoffs:** Players have limited actions and resources. Do you play a **Mitigation** card to remove Carbon, helping everyone by keeping Global Stress low but not improving your own score? Or do you play an **Adaptation** card to increase your Resilience Score, getting you closer to winning but doing nothing about the root problem? This is the game's central strategic tension.\n*   **Delayed Consequences:** Actions taken in the Action Phase (e.g., building a \"Factory\") don't have an immediate impact on the climate. The Carbon is only tallied and converted to Global Stress in the"

They must collectively keep the **Global Temperature Anomaly (GTA)** below **+2.0\u00b0C** over 10 rounds (decades) while individually developing their region's **Resilience Score**. The game ends in shared defeat if GTA hits +2.0\u00b0C or higher, but among survivors, the player with the highest Resilience Score earns distinction as the most future-ready leader. This creates a cooperative backbone with light competitive tension: you need each other to survive, but individual strategy still matters.\n\n---\n\n## 2. COMPONENTS LIST\n\n| Component | Qty | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Game Board | 1 | Central planet map with GTA track (0.0\u20132.5\u00b0C in 0.1\u00b0 increments), Emissions Pool, Carbon Sink zones, and 5 region slots |\n| Region Boards | 5 | Individual player dashboards tracking Economy (0\u201310), Wellbeing (0\u201310), Resilience (0\u201315), and local Emissions output |\n| GTA Marker | 1 | Red wooden token on the temperature track |\n| Emissions Cubes (black) | 80 | Represent CO\u2082-equivalent units entering the Emissions Pool |\n| Sink Tokens (green) | 30 | Represent natural/engineered carbon absorption capacity |\n| Decade Cards | 10 | One drawn per round; set global events, base emissions, and reveal delayed consequences from prior choices |\n| Action Cards | 60 | Four types: **Mitigate** (blue), **Adapt** (orange), **Develop** (grey), **Cooperate** (gold) |\n| Feedback Loop Tiles | 12 | Placed on the board when triggered; some amplify warming (reinforcing), some dampen it (balancing) |\n| Tipping Point Envelope | 3 | Sealed envelopes opened at secret GTA thresholds; contain irreversible system shifts |\n| Uncertainty Dice | 2 | Custom d6: faces show \u20130.1\u00b0C, 0, 0, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.1\u00b0C, +0.2\u00b0C (skewed toward warming to reflect scientific probability distributions) |\n| Delay Track | 1 | A 3-slot queue on the board where current-round emissions sit before affecting GTA (representing ocean/atmospheric lag) |\n| Resource Tokens (yellow) | 60 | Currency for playing Action Cards |\n| Score Pad & Reference Cards | 5+1 | Quick-reference for turn structure and card effects |\n\n**Total estimated component cost for production prototype: moderate (comparable to Pandemic or Catan).**\n\n---\n\n## 3. SETUP (5 minutes)\n\n1. **Place the board** centrally. Set the **GTA Marker at +0.8\u00b0C** (representing roughly present-day warming above pre-industrial baseline).\n2. **Each player** takes a Region Board and sets Economy to 5, Wellbeing to 5, Resilience to 0. Place 3 black Emissions Cubes on each region (starting local emissions).\n3. **Shuffle** the Decade Cards and stack them face-down in order (Decade 1 on top through Decade 10).\n4. **Shuffle** the Action Card deck. Deal 5 Action Cards to each player.\n5. **Place 6 Sink Tokens** on the board's Carbon Sink zones (forests, oceans, soil).\n6. **Seal the 3 Tipping Point Envelopes** and place them face-down on the marked GTA thresholds: **+1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C**. (Players know *where* they trigger but not *what* they contain.)\n7. **Fill the Delay Track** with 0 cubes in all 3 slots (clean start).\n8. Give each player **4 Resource Tokens** to start.\n\n---\n\n## 4. TURN STRUCTURE (Each Round = 1 Decade, ~4 minutes)\n\nEach round has **5 phases** executed in order:\n\n### Phase 1 \u2014 DECADE REVEAL (30 sec)\nFlip the top Decade Card. Read aloud. It specifies:\n- **Base Emissions**: number of black cubes added to the Emissions Pool (represents global background emissions from sectors players don't directly control).\n- **Event**: a global event (e.g., \"Extreme drought \u2014 all players lose 1 Wellbeing unless they have \u22653 Resilience\" or \"Technological breakthrough \u2014 Mitigate cards cost 1 fewer Resource this round\").\n- **Delayed Consequence Check**: instruction to resolve any Delay Track effects (see Phase 5).\n\n### Phase 2 \u2014 PLAYER ACTIONS (2 min, simultaneous with brief negotiation)\nEach player, in clockwise order, takes **2 actions** chosen from:\n\n| Action | Cost | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Play a Mitigate Card** | 1\u20133 Resources | Remove emissions cubes from your region or the Emissions Pool; some add Sink Tokens |\n| **Play an Adapt Card** | 1\u20132 Resources | Gain Resilience points; protect against future Decade Card penalties |\n| **Play a Develop Card** | 0\u20131 Resources | Gain Economy and Resources but **add** 1\u20132 Emissions Cubes to your region |\n| **Play a Cooperate Card** | Varies | Joint action with another willing player; stronger effects (e.g., \"Both players remove 3 cubes total and gain 1 Resilience each\") but requires mutual consent and shared cost |\n| **Harvest Resources** | Free action | Gain Resources equal to half your Economy (rounded up). No card played. |\n\nPlayers may briefly negotiate (30-second timer encouraged) before locking in actions. Trading 1 Resource between players is allowed once per round.\n\n### Phase 3 \u2014 EMISSIONS RESOLUTION (1 min)\n1. Count **total new Emissions Cubes** generated this round (from Decade Card base + all player regions' standing emissions + any Development cards played).\n2. Subtract cubes absorbed by **Sink Tokens** (each Sink Token absorbs 1 cube per round).\n3. Place **net new cubes** into the **Delay Track Slot 1** (the newest slot).\n\n### Phase 4 \u2014 WARMING & FEEDBACK (30 sec)\n1. Move cubes from **Delay Track Slot 3** (the oldest) into the central Emissions Pool. For every **5 cubes** in the Emissions Pool, increase GTA by **+0.1\u00b0C**. (Cubes remain in the pool; warming is cumulative.)\n2. Shift Delay Track: Slot 2 \u2192 Slot 3, Slot 1 \u2192 Slot 2. (This means emissions take **3 rounds/decades to fully manifest** as temperature rise.)\n3. **Roll both Uncertainty Dice**. Apply the net result to GTA. (This represents climate variability and model uncertainty \u2014 sometimes you get lucky, often you don't.)\n4. **Check Feedback Loop triggers** (see Core Mechanics).\n5. **Check Tipping Point thresholds** (see Core Mechanics).\n\n### Phase 5 \u2014 UPKEEP (30 sec)\n1. Each player draws 2 Action Cards (hand limit: 7; discard excess).\n2. Each player gains Resources equal to half their Economy (rounded up).\n3. If any player's Wellbeing = 0, they enter **Crisis**: they can only take 1 action next round and cannot play Cooperate cards.\n4. Advance the Round Marker.\n\n---\n\n## 5. CORE MECHANICS\n\n### A. The Delay Track (Delayed Consequences)\nThis is the game's signature teaching mechanic. Emissions generated now don't raise temperature for **3 rounds**. This means:\n- Early \"Develop heavy\" strategies feel painless at first \u2014 the temperature doesn't budge.\n- By rounds 5\u20137, players experience the accumulated warming from their early decisions and often feel trapped.\n- **Design intent**: Players viscerally learn that climate change has *committed warming* \u2014 what you emit today locks in consequences decades later, and by the time you see the thermometer move, it's too late to undo it.\n\n### B. Feedback Loop Tiles\nTwelve tiles are shuffled and placed in a face-down stack. When GTA crosses a **0.3\u00b0C increment** (1.1, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0), draw a Feedback Loop Tile and place it on the board. Examples:\n\n| Tile | Type | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Permafrost Thaw** | Reinforcing | +1 Emissions Cube added automatically every round from now on |\n| **Ice-Albedo Loss** | Reinforcing | Uncertainty Dice results of 0 now count as +0.1\u00b0C |\n| **Vegetation Greening** | Balancing | +1 Sink Token added to the board |\n| **Ocean Heat Uptake** | Balancing (temporary) | Absorb 2 extra cubes per round for 3 rounds, then flip to \"Ocean Acidification\" \u2014 lose 1 Sink Token permanently |\n| **Water Vapor Amplification** | Reinforcing | Each +0.1\u00b0C rise now adds 1 extra cube to the Emissions Pool |\n| **Cloud Feedback \u2014 Unknown** | Wild | Roll 1 Uncertainty Die: on +0.2, reinforcing (+1 cube/round); on \u20130.1, balancing (+1 Sink); otherwise no effect. Represents genuine scientific uncertainty. |\n\n**Design intent**: Players learn that the climate system responds to warming with its own dynamics \u2014 some make things worse, some help temporarily, and some are genuinely uncertain. The system is not linear.\n\n### C. Tipping Point Envelopes (Nonlinear Tipping Risk) \u2605\nThis is the **required nonlinear tipping mechanic**. Three sealed envelopes sit on the board at +1.3\u00b0C, +1.6\u00b0C, and +1.9\u00b0C. When GTA reaches or passes a threshold, the corresponding envelope is **opened and read aloud**. Effects are **irreversible for the rest of the game**.\n\nEnvelope contents (unknown to players until opened):\n\n- **+1.3\u00b0C \u2014 Arctic Sea Ice Collapse**: Remove 2 Sink Tokens permanently. All future Uncertainty Dice results shift +0.1\u00b0C (place a reminder token on each die). *The system has lost a buffer.*\n- **+1.6\u00b0C \u2014 Amazon Dieback**: Remove 2 more Sink Tokens. Add 2 Emissions Cubes to the pool immediately (stored carbon release). All Adapt cards now cost +1 Resource (adaptation is harder in a degraded world). *A carbon sink has become a carbon source.*\n- **+1.9\u00b0C \u2014 West Antarctic Ice Sheet Destabilization**: All players immediately lose 2 Wellbeing (sea level rise impacts). For the rest of the game, every Decade Card event that causes Wellbeing loss causes **double** the loss. *The damage accelerates and compounds.*\n\n**Why envelopes?** The sealed format creates genuine uncertainty and dread. Players know *something* bad happens at each threshold but not exactly what, mirroring how scientists understand tipping points \u2014 we know the approximate thresholds and that consequences are severe, but precise impacts carry deep uncertainty. The irreversibility teaches that some changes cannot be walked back.\n\n**Nonlinearity**: Note that each envelope makes subsequent envelopes *more likely to be triggered* (fewer sinks, shifted dice, compounding emissions). This is the hallmark of nonlinear risk \u2014 crossing one threshold makes the next one closer, creating potential cascade.\n\n### D. Mitigation vs. Adaptation Tradeoff\n- **Mitigate cards** reduce emissions (address the cause) but provide no immediate protection against Decade Card events. They're an investment in the collective future.\n- **Adapt cards** increase Resilience (protect against symptoms) but do nothing to slow warming. They're an investment in individual survival.\n- **Resource scarcity** forces genuine tradeoffs: you cannot do everything. A player who only mitigates may have low Resilience and get hammered by events. A player who only adapts free-rides on others' mitigation \u2014 but if everyone adapts and nobody mitigates, the planet warms and everyone loses.\n- **Develop cards** offer short-term economic gain (more Resources) at the cost of more emissions \u2014 the fossil-fuel development trap.\n\n### E. Cooperative Pressure with Competitive Tension\n- **Shared loss condition** (GTA \u2265 2.0\u00b0C) means players must cooperate on mitigation.\n- **Individual Resilience Scores** mean players compete for distinction *within* the cooperative frame.\n- **Cooperate cards** are the most efficient actions in the game but require mutual consent and trust \u2014 modeling international climate negotiation dynamics.\n- **No hidden roles or asymmetric powers** \u2014 all players have the same card pool and starting position, satisfying the constraint. Differentiation emerges from strategic choices, not assigned advantages.\n\n---\n\n## 6. WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS\n\n### Collective Loss (Everyone Loses)\n- **GTA reaches +2.0\u00b0C at the end of any Phase 4.** The planet has crossed into dangerous warming. All players lose regardless of individual scores.\n- **3 or more players simultaneously in Crisis** (Wellbeing = 0). Societal collapse. All players lose.\n\n### Collective Survival + Individual Distinction\nIf players complete all **10 rounds** with GTA below +2.0\u00b0C:\n- **All players win** (the planet survives).\n- The player with the **highest Resilience Score** is recognized as the most future-ready leader.\n- **Tiebreaker**: highest Wellbeing, then highest Economy.\n\n### Difficulty Scaling\n- **Standard**: Start at +0.8\u00b0C, 6 Sink Tokens, 4 starting Resources.\n- **Hard**: Start at +1.0\u00b0C, 5 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources.\n- **Nightmare**: Start at +1.1\u00b0C, 4 Sink Tokens, 3 starting Resources, and the +1.3\u00b0C envelope is opened immediately at setup.\n\n---\n\n## 7. SAMPLE ROUND (Round 3 of a 4-player game)\n\n**Current state**: GTA = +1.0\u00b0C. Delay Track: Slot 1 = 4 cubes, Slot 2 = 6 cubes, Slot 3 = 3 cubes. Emissions Pool = 8 cubes. Sink Tokens = 5. No Feedback Tiles or Tipping Envelopes triggered yet.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Decade Reveal**\nDecade Card 3 is flipped: *\"Rapid industrialization in emerging economies. Base Emissions: 6 cubes. Event: All players with Economy \u2265 7 gain +1 Resource but add 1 Emissions Cube to their region. Delayed Consequence: Resolve Delay Track Slot 3.\"*\n\nPlayer C has Economy 7 \u2014 she gains 1 Resource but must add 1 cube to her region.\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Player Actions**\n- **Player A** plays a **Mitigate Card** (\"Renewable Energy Transition\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources, remove 3 cubes from the Emissions Pool) and **Harvests Resources** (Economy 5 \u2192 gains 3 Resources).\n- **Player B** plays a **Develop Card** (\"Industrial Expansion\" \u2014 cost 0, gain +2 Economy, add 2 Emissions Cubes to his region) and plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Flood Barriers\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 2 Resilience).\n- **Player C** plays a **Cooperate Card** with Player D (\"Joint Carbon Capture Initiative\" \u2014 cost 2 Resources split between them, remove 4 cubes from the Emissions Pool and add 1 Sink Token). Player D agrees and they split the cost 1/1.\n- **Player D** (second action) plays an **Adapt Card** (\"Drought-Resistant Agriculture\" \u2014 cost 1 Resource, gain 1 Resilience and +1 Wellbeing).\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 Emissions Resolution**\n- New cubes this round: 6 (Decade base) + 3+3+4+3 (standing regional emissions from each player, Player B's went up by 2 from Development) + 1 (Player C's event cube) = **20 cubes generated**.\n- Wait \u2014 let me recalculate standing regional emissions. Each player started with 3. Player B added 2 from Develop, so Player B has 5. Player A removed some from the pool but her regional emissions are still 3. So regional totals: A=3, B=5, C=4 (3+1 event), D=3. Total regional = 15. Plus 6 base = **21 cubes generated**.\n- Sink absorption: 5 Sink Tokens + 1 new from Cooper"

This is a direct counting contradiction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{needed } 6 \\;>\\; \\text{available } 5\n\\]\n\nThis already proves infeasibility, independent of constraints (3)\u2013(6).\n\n### Minimal contradiction set\nThe infeasibility follows from **only** constraints **(1)** and **(2)** (plus the given fact that there are five reviewers and three panels). All other constraints are irrelevant because the problem is impossible even before considering them.\n\n- **(1)** forces 6 total assignments.\n- **(2)** caps total assignments at 5.\n\nHence: **no schedule exists**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can propose the *closest feasible variant* (e.g., allow one reviewer to serve on two panels, or reduce one panel to one reviewer) and then produce valid schedules satisfying (3)\u2013(6) under that relaxed model."

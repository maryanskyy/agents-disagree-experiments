Internal validity threats (causality)\n1. **Selection bias / self-selection**\n   - Volunteers are often more motivated, more tech-comfortable, have more available time, or are specifically seeking improvement.\n   - Their improvement may exceed typical students even without the tutor.\n\n2. **History (co-occurring changes)**\n   - In two weeks, students might also receive extra teacher help, start studying more because they enrolled, join a study group, etc.\n   - Any concurrent intervention can produce gains.\n\n3. **Maturation / natural learning**\n   - Students commonly improve over time simply through ongoing instruction and practice, especially over short intervals.\n\n4. **Testing/practice effects**\n   - Taking a pre-test can itself increase post-test scores (familiarity with format, topics, or test-taking strategies).\n\n5. **Regression to the mean**\n   - If students volunteered because they were disappointed with a low score (or were recruited after a low test), scores tend to move upward on retest even without any intervention.\n\n6. **Instrumentation: non-equated exams**\n   - If the post-exam was easier (or aligned better with what was practiced), the score jump is inflated.\n   - Without equating, you can\u2019t interpret a raw difference as learning gain.\n\n7. **Hawthorne / expectancy / novelty effects**\n   - Being in a trial and using a novel tool can increase effort and engagement temporarily, regardless of the tool\u2019s instructional value.\n\n8. **Attrition (not mentioned, but critical)**\n   - If weaker students dropped out or didn\u2019t complete the post-test, the post average rises mechanically.\n\n9. **Analytic flexibility**\n   - With only \u201cp < 0.05\u201d reported, we don\u2019t know:\n     - whether outcomes were chosen after looking at results,\n     - whether multiple tests were run and only the significant one highlighted,\n     - whether outliers were handled consistently.\n\n### B. External validity threats (generalization)\n- **Volunteer sample**: not representative of the broader population (different motivation/ability/resources).\n- **Two-week exposure**: may not translate to sustained learning or later exams.\n- **Context dependence**: results might only apply to that class, school, teacher, subject, or exam style.\n\n### C. Construct validity threats (what \u201cscore improvement\u201d actually means)\n- If post-test is closer to tutor items, improvement could reflect **teaching-to-the-test** rather than durable understanding.\n- \u201c25% improvement\u201d is ambiguous:\n  - +16 points on a 0\u2013100 scale,\n  - or +25% relative to baseline (64),\n  - neither directly translates to standard educational effect sizes.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Why \u201cp < 0.05 from a paired t-test\u201d is insufficient\n\nA paired t-test here tests: **Is the average within-student difference (post\u2013pre) nonzero?**  \nIt does **not** test: **Did the tutor cause the difference?**\n\nKey reasons:\n- **No counterfactual**: Without a control group, you cannot estimate what would have happened to the same students without the tutor (the causal baseline).\n- **Significance \u2260 causality**: p-values assume the model is appropriate and that the observed change is attributable to the measured condition. Here, the design violates the core assumption that the only systematic change is the intervention.\n- **Significance \u2260 practical magnitude**: Even a small or biased effect can be \u201csignificant\u201d in some settings, and a large observed change can be largely artifact (e.g., easier post-test) while still yielding small p.\n- **p-value ignores design bias**: Randomization and measurement validity drive causal interpretability; p-values do not \u201ccorrect\u201d for confounding, selection, or non-equivalent exams.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Minimally credible redesign (feasible within one school term)\n\nGoal: produce an estimate with defensible causal interpretation, while remaining practical.\n\n### A. Sampling and recruitment\n- **Population**: all students enrolled in the relevant course(s) in the term (not just volunteers), or at least recruit broadly and record participation rates.\n- **Inclusion**: specify eligibility (e.g., enrolled in Algebra I, attending school regularly).\n- **Baseline data**: collect prior grades, prior standardized scores, attendance, demographic covariates, and baseline motivation/tech access (for balance checks and heterogeneity).\n\n### B. Randomization (preferred)\n**Option 1: Individual-level RCT (strongest, simplest)**\n- Randomly assign students to:\n  1) **AI tutor** + business-as-usual instruction  \n  2) **Control condition** + business-as-usual instruction\n- Control should be credible:\n  - either **active control** (time-matched alternative like standard practice problems without AI feedback),\n  - or **placebo-like** (a generic study app), to reduce novelty and expectancy differences.\n- Ensure **equal time-on-task** expectations (e.g., 20 minutes/day, 4 days/week).\n- Monitor usage logs to measure adherence.\n\n**Option 2: Cluster RCT (if contamination is likely)**\n- Randomize by class/teacher/period to avoid students sharing answers/features.\n- Use enough clusters if possible; if only a few classes, analysis must account for clustering and power will be limited, but it\u2019s still more credible than pre\u2013post only.\n\n### C. Quasi-experimental fallback (if randomization is blocked)\nIf school policy prevents random assignment:\n\n**Stepped-wedge design (practical compromise)**\n- All classes eventually get the tutor, but rollout order is randomized.\n- Early adopters act as treatment while later adopters serve as controls during the initial phase.\n- Works well within a term and is often acceptable to schools because no one is denied access.\n\n**Matched comparison (last resort)**\n- Identify comparable students/classes not using the tutor.\n- Use propensity score matching or covariate adjustment with baseline test scores and prior achievement.\n- Still weaker than randomization because unmeasured confounding can remain.\n\n### D. Outcome measurement (fix the \u201cnon-equated exam\u201d problem)\n1. **Primary outcome**\n   - Use a **common, standardized assessment** or a **teacher-independent test** created in advance.\n   - If using pre/post tests, use **parallel forms** (Form A and B) that are **equated** for difficulty (pilot them or use item-response methods if feasible).\n2. **Blinding**\n   - Ideally, graders blinded to group assignment (especially for constructed responses).\n3. **Timing**\n   - Pre-test at start of intervention.\n   - Post-test at end of term (or end of unit), plus optionally a **delayed retention test** 2\u20134 weeks later to assess durable learning.\n4. **Secondary outcomes**\n   - Course exam scores, homework completion, time-on-task, confidence measures\u2014but declare these as secondary to avoid outcome fishing.\n\n### E. Pre-registration and analysis plan (to reduce \u201cresearcher degrees of freedom\u201d)\nPre-register (OSF, AEA registry, or similar) before seeing outcomes:\n- Hypotheses (primary and secondary).\n- Primary outcome and how it\u2019s scored.\n- Randomization procedure and unit (student vs class).\n- Sample size target and a power rationale (even rough, based on detectable effect).\n- Inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., minimum usage threshold\u2014if used, analyze both ITT and per-protocol).\n- Primary estimand: **intention-to-treat (ITT)** difference in post-test scores (or gain scores) between groups.\n- Statistical model:\n  - ANCOVA: post-test ~ group + pre-test (+ covariates), with cluster-robust SEs if clustered.\n- Handling missing data and attrition.\n- Multiple comparisons policy (e.g., only one primary outcome; adjust or clearly label exploratory outcomes).\n\n---\n\n## 5) What claim *is* justified from current evidence?\n\nFrom the described study, the only defensible statement is along the lines of:\n\n> \u201cIn a two-week voluntary pilot with 40 students, average scores increased from 64 to 80 on a non-equated pre/post assessment; this change is statistically different from zero within the sample, but the study design does not support a causal conclusion that the AI tutor produced the improvement or that the effect would generalize.\u201d\n\nIt does **not** justify \u201cimproves exam scores by 25%\u201d as a broad, causal effectiveness claim.",

      "text": "## Critical evaluation of the claim \u201cOur AI tutor improves exam scores by 25%\u201d\n\n### 1) The reported result is not a credible estimate of *causal* impact\nThey observed: 40 volunteers used the tutor for two weeks; mean score increased from 64 to 80 (+16 points). They call this \u201c25%\u201d (likely 16/64). This is a **pre\u2013post change in a self-selected group**, not evidence that the tutor *caused* the improvement, and not evidence it would generalize broadly.\n\nA contrarian but realistic interpretation: **most of that gain could occur even if the tutor had zero effect**, due to routine learning, test differences, and selection.\n\n---\n\n## Methodological threats to validity (what could explain the gain without the tutor)\n\n### A. Selection bias / volunteer bias (self-selection)\nStudents opted in. Volunteers are often:\n- more motivated,\n- more anxious about performance (thus more likely to study),\n- more engaged with novelty,\n- more likely to comply.\n\nThis alone can inflate pre\u2013post gains. It also destroys generalizability: \u201cworks for volunteers\u201d \u2260 \u201cworks for typical students.\u201d\n\n### B. History + maturation (normal learning over time)\nOver two weeks, students may improve because:\n- they attended classes,\n- covered more material,\n- did homework,\n- received teacher feedback,\n- simply had more time with content.\n\nWithout a comparison group experiencing the same term progression but **without** the tutor, you cannot separate tool effect from ordinary instruction.\n\n### C. Regression to the mean\nIf students joined because their score was low (64 is not terrible, but could be below their usual), then some improvement is expected purely statistically on re-test\u2014even with no intervention.\n\n### D. Testing/practice effects\nTaking an exam once can improve performance on a later exam because students:\n- become familiar with the format,\n- learn what is emphasized,\n- reduce anxiety.\n\nAgain: without control, you are measuring re-test/practice effects.\n\n### E. Non-equivalent outcome measures (exams not equated for difficulty)\nThey explicitly did not equate difficulty. If the post exam was easier, the gain could be an artifact. This is arguably the single biggest direct threat because it can produce large mean shifts mechanically.\n\n### F. Instrumentation / scoring differences\nEven subtle changes in:\n- grading strictness,\n- partial credit,\n- question types,\ncan create apparent improvement unrelated to learning.\n\n### G. Hawthorne/novelty and demand characteristics\nParticipants know they are in a trial and may:\n- work harder because they\u2019re being observed,\n- report higher engagement,\n- try to \u201chelp\u201d the study succeed.\n\n### H. Attrition and selective reporting (unknown)\nWe\u2019re not told whether all 40 completed both exams or whether some dropped out. If weaker performers dropped out, the post mean rises spuriously. Also, the company chose this analysis and outcome; without preregistration, there\u2019s room for \u201cresearcher degrees of freedom.\u201d\n\n### I. Short duration + unclear construct\nTwo weeks is short. Even if scores rose, we don\u2019t know whether this reflects:\n- durable learning,\n- transfer to different questions,\n- or short-term cramming aligned to the post test.\n\n---\n\n## Why p < 0.05 from a paired t-test is insufficient\n\n### 1) Statistical significance is not causal identification\nA paired t-test answers: **\u201cIs the average pre\u2013post difference in this sample distinguishable from zero?\u201d**\nIt does *not* answer: **\u201cWould the same students have improved by the same amount without the tutor?\u201d**  \nThat counterfactual requires a control/comparator or a stronger quasi-experimental design.\n\n### 2) p-values ignore systematic bias\nEven with p < 0.001, you could still be measuring:\n- easier post-test,\n- normal instruction effects,\n- selection bias,\n- regression to the mean.\n\np-values quantify random sampling error (under assumptions), not these threats.\n\n### 3) The \u201c25% improvement\u201d framing is potentially misleading\n- Relative improvement (16/64) sounds big.\n- Absolute gain is +16 points; whether that\u2019s meaningful depends on scale, variance, and test comparability.\n- Without equating, the scale itself may not be stable.\n\n### 4) Generalization is unjustified\nEven if the within-sample change is real, volunteers in one setting for two weeks do not support \u201cbroad effectiveness.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## A minimally credible redesign within one school term\n\nYou can do this in ~8\u201312 weeks with modest overhead.\n\n### Goal\nEstimate the **causal effect** of access to the AI tutor on exam performance, under realistic classroom conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Sampling / recruitment\n- **Population:** students enrolled in the relevant course(s) across one school (or multiple classes) in the term.\n- **Recruitment:** invite *all* eligible students, not just volunteers. Obtain consent/assent as required.\n- **Record baseline covariates:** prior GPA or prior exam scores, attendance, demographic variables (as allowed), and baseline diagnostic test.\n\nIf participation must be voluntary, still recruit broadly and document differences between participants and non-participants.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Randomization (preferred): individual-level RCT with waitlist control\n**Design:** Randomly assign consenting students to:\n- **Treatment:** AI tutor access + usage encouragement\n- **Control (waitlist):** no tutor until after the study (ethical sweetener)\n\n**Why this is minimal and strong:**  \nWithin the same class/term, both groups experience identical teaching, timing, and school environment. Randomization balances motivation and prior ability *on average*.\n\n**Practical details**\n- Stratify randomization by baseline score (e.g., terciles) and/or class section to ensure balance.\n- Prevent contamination as best you can (accounts tied to student IDs; remind students not to share access).\n- Track actual usage (minutes, sessions, topics) for compliance analysis.\n\n**Analysis plan**\n- Primary: intention-to-treat (ITT): compare end-of-term outcomes by assignment, regardless of usage.\n- Secondary: dose\u2013response, but clearly labeled exploratory (usage is not randomized).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Quasi-experimental fallback (if randomization is blocked)\nIf the school refuses random assignment, use one of these (in order of credibility):\n\n**A. Stepped-wedge rollout (strong quasi-experimental)**\n- Roll out the tutor to different classes at different times, assigned by random schedule if possible.\n- Everyone eventually gets it, but timing creates comparison periods.\n\n**B. Matched comparison + difference-in-differences**\n- Choose a comparable class/school not using the tutor.\n- Use baseline and end-of-term measures; compare change over time across groups.\n- Matching on baseline scores and teacher/class characteristics helps but does not fully solve unobserved confounding.\n\n**C. Regression discontinuity (if there is an assignment rule)**\n- If access is based on a cutoff (e.g., students below 65 get access), you can estimate local causal effects around the cutoff.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Outcome measurement (fix the biggest flaw: non-equated exams)\n\n**Primary outcome**\n- A **standardized assessment** aligned to the curriculum with:\n  - the same blueprint pre and post,\n  - parallel forms **equated** for difficulty (common-item equating), or\n  - the exact same test with secure item bank and delayed retest (less ideal due to practice effects).\n\n**Minimum viable approach within a term**\n- Build two parallel forms (A and B) from an item bank.\n- Include ~20% anchor items common to both forms.\n- Randomly assign which form is used as pre vs post across students (counterbalancing) to reduce form effects.\n\n**Secondary outcomes**\n- Course exam grades (if standardized across sections)\n- Retention test 4\u20136 weeks later (durability)\n- Time-on-task measures and engagement (not as primary)\n\n**Blinding**\n- If human grading is involved, graders should be blinded to group assignment.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Pre-registration / transparency (cheap, high value)\nPre-register before seeing outcomes (OSF or similar):\n- Hypotheses (primary + secondary)\n- Primary outcome and time window\n- Inclusion/exclusion rules (e.g., missing post-test)\n- Randomization procedure and stratification\n- Sample size target and stopping rule\n- Statistical model (e.g., ANCOVA: post-test ~ group + pre-test)\n- Multiple comparisons handling\n- Plan to report effect sizes + confidence intervals, not only p-values\n\nAlso commit to:\n- reporting all measured outcomes,\n- sharing de-identified data/code when feasible,\n- documenting deviations.\n\n---\n\n## What claim is actually justified by the current evidence?\n\nFrom the described study, the only defensible claim is descriptive:\n\n> \u201cAmong 40 self-selected students who used our tutor for two weeks, average scores on a subsequent (non-equated) exam were higher than on a prior exam.\u201d\n\nYou **cannot** credibly claim:\n- the tutor caused the improvement,\n- the magnitude is ~25%,\n- the effect generalizes beyond these volunteers,\n- or that p < 0.05 validates broad effectiveness.\n\nIf forced into one sentence: **they have evidence of a pre\u2013post association in a volunteer sample, not evidence of causal effectiveness.**",

It is **not** evidence that the AI tutor *caused* the improvement, and it does not justify a broad effectiveness claim.\n\n---\n\n## Methodological threats to validity (why causality is not supported)\n\n### A. Selection bias / volunteer bias (self-selection)\nStudents opted into the trial. Volunteers are typically:\n- more motivated,\n- more conscientious,\n- more willing to study,\n- possibly those who believe they will benefit.\n\nThis alone can produce gains regardless of the tutor (motivational confounding). It also undermines generalization to typical students.\n\n### B. No control group \u2192 cannot rule out alternative explanations\nWithout a control group, any pre\u2013post change can be caused by:\n- normal learning progression,\n- increased study time for reasons unrelated to the tutor,\n- teacher help, peer tutoring, other resources,\n- approaching exam dates increasing effort.\n\nA control group is the minimal requirement to separate \u201ctutor effect\u201d from \u201ctime/attention/effort effects.\u201d\n\n### C. Regression to the mean\nIf students joined because they recently did poorly (or were worried), then unusually low baseline scores tend to increase on retest even with no intervention. This can inflate apparent gains in uncontrolled pre\u2013post designs.\n\n### D. Testing/practice effects\nIf the \u201cbefore\u201d exam is similar in format/content to the \u201cafter\u201d exam, students may improve simply because:\n- they learned how the test works,\n- they remember items,\n- anxiety is reduced on the second attempt.\n\nThis is especially likely over a two-week window.\n\n### E. Non-equated exams (instrumentation threat)\nThey explicitly did **not equate difficulty**. If the post-test was easier, or better aligned to what students studied, then the score increase is uninterpretable. This is a direct measurement validity failure.\n\n### F. History and maturation (short window doesn\u2019t eliminate these)\nEven within two weeks:\n- a teacher might have covered relevant material,\n- students may have had homework/revision sessions,\n- external events (review class) could influence performance.\n\n### G. Hawthorne/novelty and expectation effects\nStudents knew they were using a new tool and being observed, which can increase engagement temporarily. If the company provided encouragement/support, that\u2019s an additional confound.\n\n### H. Attrition (not reported)\nIf some students started but didn\u2019t finish (or were excluded), results can be biased upward if lower-improving students drop out. This is common in edtech pilots.\n\n### I. Analysis flexibility and reporting bias\nOnly one analysis is reported (paired t-test). Without pre-registration, there is risk of:\n- choosing favorable outcomes/tests after seeing the data,\n- selectively reporting the most positive subgroup or metric.\n\n---\n\n## Why \u201cp < 0.05 from a paired t-test\u201d is insufficient\n\n### 1) Statistical significance \u2260 causal identification\nA paired t-test answers: *\u201cIs the average post score different from the average pre score in this sample?\u201d*  \nIt does **not** answer: *\u201cWould these students have improved this much without the tutor?\u201d*\n\nCausality requires a counterfactual. Without a control (or credible quasi-experimental comparison), the counterfactual is unknown.\n\n### 2) p-values ignore systematic bias\nEven a perfectly computed p-value cannot correct for:\n- selection bias,\n- non-equated tests,\n- regression to the mean,\n- time trends.\n\nYou can get p < 0.001 and still be wrong about causation if the design is confounded.\n\n### 3) Magnitude framing (\u201c25% improvement\u201d) is potentially misleading\n- They implicitly interpret 64\u219280 as \u201c25%,\u201d but that\u2019s a **relative change in points**, not necessarily a meaningful educational effect (and not standardized).\n- Without consistent scaling and equated forms, the percentage is not stable or interpretable across contexts.\n\n---\n\n## Minimally credible redesign achievable within one school term\n\nYou want something that (a) identifies a causal effect credibly, (b) is feasible, and (c) minimizes disruption.\n\n### Option 1 (preferred): Randomized controlled trial (individual-level or cluster)\n\n#### Sampling\n- Recruit **multiple classes** (or schools) to avoid one-teacher/one-class idiosyncrasies.\n- Include **all eligible students** in those classes (opt-out consent if possible), not just volunteers, to reduce selection bias.\n- Predefine inclusion/exclusion (e.g., enrolled in course X; not already using the tool).\n\n#### Randomization\nTwo feasible approaches:\n\n**A. Individual randomization within each class**\n- Randomly assign students to:\n  1) **AI tutor** (treatment)\n  2) **Control condition**: business-as-usual study OR an active control like standard practice questions/time-on-task matched.\n- Stratify randomization by baseline score (e.g., terciles) to improve balance.\n\n**B. Cluster randomization (by class)**\n- Randomize entire classes to AI tutor vs control to reduce contamination (students sharing access).\n- Needs more classes to achieve power, but often easier operationally.\n\n#### Intervention protocol (reduce \u201cdose\u201d ambiguity)\n- Set a target usage, e.g., **90 minutes/week** for 6\u20138 weeks.\n- Log usage automatically (minutes, items attempted, mastery).\n- Specify what support is allowed (teacher help equal across arms).\n\n#### Outcome measurement (make it defensible)\nPrimary outcome should be:\n- a **post-test that is equated** to the pre-test (parallel forms) or a standardized external assessment.\n- Administered under similar conditions (time, proctoring).\n\nMeasurement details:\n- Use **two parallel forms** created from the same blueprint (same topic distribution, difficulty calibration).\n- Ideally include some **anchor items** to equate difficulty statistically.\n- Blind grading if open-ended responses.\n\nAlso specify:\n- Secondary outcomes: course grade, retention test 4 weeks later, time-to-mastery metrics.\n- But clearly label one **primary endpoint** to avoid cherry-picking.\n\n#### Analysis plan\n- Primary analysis: compare post-test scores between groups adjusting for pre-test (ANCOVA) or analyze gain scores with baseline adjustment.\n- Use **intention-to-treat**: analyze students in assigned groups regardless of usage (prevents bias from \u201conly compliers\u201d).\n- Report effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d) and confidence intervals, not just p-values.\n\n#### Pre-registration and transparency (minimal but real)\nBefore data collection:\n- Register hypotheses, primary outcome, analysis model, exclusion rules, and handling of missing data (e.g., multiple imputation or conservative assumptions).\n- Commit to reporting all prespecified outcomes and the flow of participants (CONSORT-style diagram).\n\n---\n\n### Option 2 (fallback if randomization is blocked): Quasi-experimental design within a term\n\nIf the school refuses random assignment, minimally credible alternatives:\n\n#### A. Stepped-wedge rollout (often acceptable)\n- All classes eventually get the tutor, but the **start date is randomized**.\n- Early-start classes serve as controls for late-start classes during the initial period.\n- This preserves some randomization while meeting \u201ceveryone gets it\u201d constraints.\n\n#### B. Matched comparison + difference-in-differences (weaker)\n- Identify comparable students/classes not using the tutor.\n- Match on baseline score, prior grades, demographics, teacher, and course track.\n- Use **difference-in-differences**: compare change over time in treatment vs comparison.\n- Still vulnerable to unmeasured confounding, but much better than uncontrolled pre\u2013post.\n\nEven in quasi-experimental designs, equated testing and pre-registration still matter.\n\n---\n\n## What claim is actually justified from the current evidence?\n\nA defensible statement from what they\u2019ve shown is:\n\n> \u201cIn a two-week pilot with 40 self-selected volunteers, average scores increased from 64 to 80 on a non-equated pre/post exam while students used our tutor. This is consistent with improvement over time, but the design does not establish that the tutor caused the increase or that the result generalizes.\u201d\n\nAnything like \u201cimproves exam scores by 25%\u201d or broad effectiveness claims is **not justified** without a control/comparison and valid outcome measurement.",

They call this \u201c25%\u201d (likely 16/64). This is a **pre\u2013post change in a self-selected group**, not evidence that the tutor *caused* the improvement, and not evidence it would generalize broadly.\n\nA contrarian but realistic interpretation: **most of that gain could occur even if the tutor had zero effect**, due to routine learning, test differences, and selection.\n\n---\n\n## Methodological threats to validity (what could explain the gain without the tutor)\n\n### A. Selection bias / volunteer bias (self-selection)\nStudents opted in. Volunteers are often:\n- more motivated,\n- more anxious about performance (thus more likely to study),\n- more engaged with novelty,\n- more likely to comply.\n\nThis alone can inflate pre\u2013post gains. It also destroys generalizability: \u201cworks for volunteers\u201d \u2260 \u201cworks for typical students.\u201d\n\n### B. History + maturation (normal learning over time)\nOver two weeks, students may improve because:\n- they attended classes,\n- covered more material,\n- did homework,\n- received teacher feedback,\n- simply had more time with content.\n\nWithout a comparison group experiencing the same term progression but **without** the tutor, you cannot separate tool effect from ordinary instruction.\n\n### C.

Testing/practice effects\nTaking an exam once can improve performance on a later exam because students:\n- become familiar with the format,\n- learn what is emphasized,\n- reduce anxiety.\n\nAgain: without control, you are measuring re-test/practice effects.\n\n### E. Non-equivalent outcome measures (exams not equated for difficulty)\nThey explicitly did not equate difficulty. If the post exam was easier, the gain could be an artifact.

Attrition and selective reporting (unknown)\nWe\u2019re not told whether all 40 completed both exams or whether some dropped out. If weaker performers dropped out, the post mean rises spuriously. Also, the company chose this analysis and outcome; without preregistration, there\u2019s room for \u201cresearcher degrees of freedom.\u201d\n\n### I. Short duration + unclear construct\nTwo weeks is short. Even if scores rose, we don\u2019t know whether this reflects:\n- durable learning,\n- transfer to different questions,\n- or short-term cramming aligned to the post test.\n\n---\n\n## Why p < 0.05 from a paired t-test is insufficient\n\n### 1) Statistical significance is not causal identification\nA paired t-test answers: **\u201cIs the average pre\u2013post difference in this sample distinguishable from zero?\u201d**\nIt does *not* answer: **\u201cWould the same students have improved by the same amount without the tutor?\u201d**  \nThat counterfactual requires a control/comparator or a stronger quasi-experimental design.\n\n### 2) p-values ignore systematic bias\nEven with p < 0.001, you could still be measuring:\n- easier post-test,\n- normal instruction effects,\n- selection bias,\n- regression to the mean.\n\np-values quantify random sampling error (under assumptions), not these threats.\n\n### 3) The \u201c25% improvement\u201d framing is potentially misleading\n- Relative improvement (16/64) sounds big.\n- Absolute gain is +16 points; whether that\u2019s meaningful depends on scale, variance, and test comparability.\n- Without equating, the scale itself may not be stable.\n\n### 4) Generalization is unjustified\nEven if the within-sample change is real, volunteers in one setting for two weeks do not support \u201cbroad effectiveness.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## A minimally credible redesign within one school term\n\nYou can do this in ~8\u201312 weeks with modest overhead.\n\n### Goal\nEstimate the **causal effect** of access to the AI tutor on exam performance, under realistic classroom conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Sampling / recruitment\n- **Population:** students enrolled in the relevant course(s) across one school (or multiple classes) in the term.\n- **Recruitment:** invite *all* eligible students, not just volunteers. Obtain consent/assent as required.\n- **Record baseline covariates:** prior GPA or prior exam scores, attendance, demographic variables (as allowed), and baseline diagnostic test.\n\nIf participation must be voluntary, still recruit broadly and document differences between participants and non-participants.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Randomization (preferred): individual-level RCT with waitlist control\n**Design:** Randomly assign consenting students to:\n- **Treatment:** AI tutor access + usage encouragement\n- **Control (waitlist):** no tutor until after the study (ethical sweetener)\n\n**Why this is minimal and strong:**  \nWithin the same class/term, both groups experience identical teaching, timing, and school environment. Randomization balances motivation and prior ability *on average*.\n\n**Practical details**\n- Stratify randomization by baseline score (e.g., terciles) and/or class section to ensure balance.\n- Prevent contamination as best you can (accounts tied to student IDs; remind students not to share access).\n- Track actual usage (minutes, sessions, topics) for compliance analysis.\n\n**Analysis plan**\n- Primary: intention-to-treat (ITT): compare end-of-term outcomes by assignment, regardless of usage.\n- Secondary: dose\u2013response, but clearly labeled exploratory (usage is not randomized).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Quasi-experimental fallback (if randomization is blocked)\nIf the school refuses random assignment, use one of these (in order of credibility):\n\n**A. Stepped-wedge rollout (strong quasi-experimental)**\n- Roll out the tutor to different classes at different times, assigned by random schedule if possible.\n- Everyone eventually gets it, but timing creates comparison periods.\n\n**B. Matched comparison + difference-in-differences**\n- Choose a comparable class/school not using the tutor.\n- Use baseline and end-of-term measures; compare change over time across groups.\n- Matching on baseline scores and teacher/class characteristics helps but does not fully solve unobserved confounding.\n\n**C. Regression discontinuity (if there is an assignment rule)**\n- If access is based on a cutoff (e.g., students below 65 get access), you can estimate local causal effects around the cutoff.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Outcome measurement (fix the biggest flaw: non-equated exams)\n\n**Primary outcome**\n- A **standardized assessment** aligned to the curriculum with:\n  - the same blueprint pre and post,\n  - parallel forms **equated** for difficulty (common-item equating), or\n  - the exact same test with secure item bank and delayed retest (less ideal due to practice effects).\n\n**Minimum viable approach within a term**\n- Build two parallel forms (A and B) from an item bank.\n- Include ~20% anchor items common to both forms.\n- Randomly assign which form is used as pre vs post across students (counterbalancing) to reduce form effects.\n\n**Secondary outcomes**\n- Course exam grades (if standardized across sections)\n- Retention test 4\u20136 weeks later (durability)\n- Time-on-task measures and engagement (not as primary)\n\n**Blinding**\n- If human grading is involved, graders should be blinded to group assignment.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Pre-registration / transparency (cheap, high value)\nPre-register before seeing outcomes (OSF or similar):\n- Hypotheses (primary + secondary)\n- Primary outcome and time window\n- Inclusion/exclusion rules (e.g., missing post-test)\n- Randomization procedure and stratification\n- Sample size target and stopping rule\n- Statistical model (e.g., ANCOVA: post-test ~ group + pre-test)\n- Multiple comparisons handling\n- Plan to report effect sizes + confidence intervals, not only p-values\n\nAlso commit to:\n- reporting all measured outcomes,\n- sharing de-identified data/code when feasible,\n- documenting deviations.\n\n---\n\n## What claim is actually justified by the current evidence?\n\nFrom the described study, the only defensible claim is descriptive:\n\n> \u201cAmong 40 self-selected students who used our tutor for two weeks, average scores on a subsequent (non-equated) exam were higher than on a prior exam.\u201d\n\nYou **cannot** credibly claim:\n- the tutor caused the improvement,\n- the magnitude is ~25%,\n- the effect generalizes beyond these volunteers,\n- or that p < 0.05 validates broad effectiveness.\n\nIf forced into one sentence: **they have evidence of a pre\u2013post association in a volunteer sample, not evidence of causal effectiveness.**",

Internal validity threats (causality)\n1. **Selection bias / self-selection**\n   - Volunteers are often more motivated, more tech-comfortable, have more available time, or are specifically seeking improvement.\n   - Their improvement may exceed typical students even without the tutor.\n\n2. **History (co-occurring changes)**\n   - In two weeks, students might also receive extra teacher help, start studying more because they enrolled, join a study group, etc.\n   - Any concurrent intervention can produce gains.\n\n3. **Maturation / natural learning**\n   - Students commonly improve over time simply through ongoing instruction and practice, especially over short intervals.\n\n4. **Testing/practice effects**\n   - Taking a pre-test can itself increase post-test scores (familiarity with format, topics, or test-taking strategies).\n\n5. **Regression to the mean**\n   - If students volunteered because they were disappointed with a low score (or were recruited after a low test), scores tend to move upward on retest even without any intervention.\n\n6. **Instrumentation: non-equated exams**\n   - If the post-exam was easier (or aligned better with what was practiced), the score jump is inflated.\n   - Without equating, you can\u2019t interpret a raw difference as learning gain.\n\n7. **Hawthorne / expectancy / novelty effects**\n   - Being in a trial and using a novel tool can increase effort and engagement temporarily, regardless of the tool\u2019s instructional value.\n\n8. **Attrition (not mentioned, but critical)**\n   - If weaker students dropped out or didn\u2019t complete the post-test, the post average rises mechanically.\n\n9. **Analytic flexibility**\n   - With only \u201cp < 0.05\u201d reported, we don\u2019t know:\n     - whether outcomes were chosen after looking at results,\n     - whether multiple tests were run and only the significant one highlighted,\n     - whether outliers were handled consistently.\n\n### B. External validity threats (generalization)\n- **Volunteer sample**: not representative of the broader population (different motivation/ability/resources).\n- **Two-week exposure**: may not translate to sustained learning or later exams.\n- **Context dependence**: results might only apply to that class, school, teacher, subject, or exam style.\n\n### C. Construct validity threats (what \u201cscore improvement\u201d actually means)\n- If post-test is closer to tutor items, improvement could reflect **teaching-to-the-test** rather than durable understanding.\n- \u201c25% improvement\u201d is ambiguous:\n  - +16 points on a 0\u2013100 scale,\n  - or +25% relative to baseline (64),\n  - neither directly translates to standard educational effect sizes.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Why \u201cp < 0.05 from a paired t-test\u201d is insufficient\n\nA paired t-test here tests: **Is the average within-student difference (post\u2013pre) nonzero?**  \nIt does **not** test: **Did the tutor cause the difference?**\n\nKey reasons:\n- **No counterfactual**: Without a control group, you cannot estimate what would have happened to the same students without the tutor (the causal baseline).\n- **Significance \u2260 causality**: p-values assume the model is appropriate and that the observed change is attributable to the measured condition. Here, the design violates the core assumption that the only systematic change is the intervention.\n- **Significance \u2260 practical magnitude**: Even a small or biased effect can be \u201csignificant\u201d in some settings, and a large observed change can be largely artifact (e.g., easier post-test) while still yielding small p.\n- **p-value ignores design bias**: Randomization and measurement validity drive causal interpretability; p-values do not \u201ccorrect\u201d for confounding, selection, or non-equivalent exams.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Minimally credible redesign (feasible within one school term)\n\nGoal: produce an estimate with defensible causal interpretation, while remaining practical.\n\n### A. Sampling and recruitment\n- **Population**: all students enrolled in the relevant course(s) in the term (not just volunteers), or at least recruit broadly and record participation rates.\n- **Inclusion**: specify eligibility (e.g., enrolled in Algebra I, attending school regularly).\n- **Baseline data**: collect prior grades, prior standardized scores, attendance, demographic covariates, and baseline motivation/tech access (for balance checks and heterogeneity).\n\n### B. Randomization (preferred)\n**Option 1: Individual-level RCT (strongest, simplest)**\n- Randomly assign students to:\n  1) **AI tutor** + business-as-usual instruction  \n  2) **Control condition** + business-as-usual instruction\n- Control should be credible:\n  - either **active control** (time-matched alternative like standard practice problems without AI feedback),\n  - or **placebo-like** (a generic study app), to reduce novelty and expectancy differences.\n- Ensure **equal time-on-task** expectations (e.g., 20 minutes/day, 4 days/week).\n- Monitor usage logs to measure adherence.\n\n**Option 2: Cluster RCT (if contamination is likely)**\n- Randomize by class/teacher/period to avoid students sharing answers/features.\n- Use enough clusters if possible; if only a few classes, analysis must account for clustering and power will be limited, but it\u2019s still more credible than pre\u2013post only.\n\n### C. Quasi-experimental fallback (if randomization is blocked)\nIf school policy prevents random assignment:\n\n**Stepped-wedge design (practical compromise)**\n- All classes eventually get the tutor, but rollout order is randomized.\n- Early adopters act as treatment while later adopters serve as controls during the initial phase.\n- Works well within a term and is often acceptable to schools because no one is denied access.\n\n**Matched comparison (last resort)**\n- Identify comparable students/classes not using the tutor.\n- Use propensity score matching or covariate adjustment with baseline test scores and prior achievement.\n- Still weaker than randomization because unmeasured confounding can remain.\n\n### D. Outcome measurement (fix the \u201cnon-equated exam\u201d problem)\n1. **Primary outcome**\n   - Use a **common, standardized assessment** or a **teacher-independent test** created in advance.\n   - If using pre/post tests, use **parallel forms** (Form A and B) that are **equated** for difficulty (pilot them or use item-response methods if feasible).\n2. **Blinding**\n   - Ideally, graders blinded to group assignment (especially for constructed responses).\n3. **Timing**\n   - Pre-test at start of intervention.\n   - Post-test at end of term (or end of unit), plus optionally a **delayed retention test** 2\u20134 weeks later to assess durable learning.\n4. **Secondary outcomes**\n   - Course exam scores, homework completion, time-on-task, confidence measures\u2014but declare these as secondary to avoid outcome fishing.\n\n### E. Pre-registration and analysis plan (to reduce \u201cresearcher degrees of freedom\u201d)\nPre-register (OSF, AEA registry, or similar) before seeing outcomes:\n- Hypotheses (primary and secondary).\n- Primary outcome and how it\u2019s scored.\n- Randomization procedure and unit (student vs class).\n- Sample size target and a power rationale (even rough, based on detectable effect).\n- Inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., minimum usage threshold\u2014if used, analyze both ITT and per-protocol).\n- Primary estimand: **intention-to-treat (ITT)** difference in post-test scores (or gain scores) between groups.\n- Statistical model:\n  - ANCOVA: post-test ~ group + pre-test (+ covariates), with cluster-robust SEs if clustered.\n- Handling missing data and attrition.\n- Multiple comparisons policy (e.g., only one primary outcome; adjust or clearly label exploratory outcomes).\n\n---\n\n## 5) What claim *is* justified from current evidence?\n\nFrom the described study, the only defensible statement is along the lines of:\n\n> \u201cIn a two-week voluntary pilot with 40 students, average scores increased from 64 to 80 on a non-equated pre/post assessment; this change is statistically different from zero within the sample, but the study design does not support a causal conclusion that the AI tutor produced the improvement or that the effect would generalize.\u201d\n\nIt does **not** justify \u201cimproves exam scores by 25%\u201d as a broad, causal effectiveness claim."

Even if scores rose, we don\u2019t know whether this reflects:\n- durable learning,\n- transfer to different questions,\n- or short-term cramming aligned to the post test.\n\n---\n\n## Why p < 0.05 from a paired t-test is insufficient\n\n### 1) Statistical significance is not causal identification\nA paired t-test answers: **\u201cIs the average pre\u2013post difference in this sample distinguishable from zero?\u201d**\nIt does *not* answer: **\u201cWould the same students have improved by the same amount without the tutor?\u201d**  \nThat counterfactual requires a control/comparator or a stronger quasi-experimental design.\n\n### 2) p-values ignore systematic bias\nEven with p < 0.001, you could still be measuring:\n- easier post-test,\n- normal instruction effects,\n- selection bias,\n- regression to the mean.\n\np-values quantify random sampling error (under assumptions), not these threats.\n\n### 3) The \u201c25% improvement\u201d framing is potentially misleading\n- Relative improvement (16/64) sounds big.\n- Absolute gain is +16 points; whether that\u2019s meaningful depends on scale, variance, and test comparability.\n- Without equating, the scale itself may not be stable.\n\n### 4) Generalization is unjustified\nEven if the within-sample change is real, volunteers in one setting for two weeks do not support \u201cbroad effectiveness.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## A minimally credible redesign within one school term\n\nYou can do this in ~8\u201312 weeks with modest overhead.\n\n### Goal\nEstimate the **causal effect** of access to the AI tutor on exam performance, under realistic classroom conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Sampling / recruitment\n- **Population:** students enrolled in the relevant course(s) across one school (or multiple classes) in the term.\n- **Recruitment:** invite *all* eligible students, not just volunteers. Obtain consent/assent as required.\n- **Record baseline covariates:** prior GPA or prior exam scores, attendance, demographic variables (as allowed), and baseline diagnostic test.\n\nIf participation must be voluntary, still recruit broadly and document differences between participants and non-participants.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Randomization (preferred): individual-level RCT with waitlist control\n**Design:** Randomly assign consenting students to:\n- **Treatment:** AI tutor access + usage encouragement\n- **Control (waitlist):** no tutor until after the study (ethical sweetener)\n\n**Why this is minimal and strong:**  \nWithin the same class/term, both groups experience identical teaching, timing, and school environment. Randomization balances motivation and prior ability *on average*.\n\n**Practical details**\n- Stratify randomization by baseline score (e.g., terciles) and/or class section to ensure balance.\n- Prevent contamination as best you can (accounts tied to student IDs; remind students not to share access).\n- Track actual usage (minutes, sessions, topics) for compliance analysis.\n\n**Analysis plan**\n- Primary: intention-to-treat (ITT): compare end-of-term outcomes by assignment, regardless of usage.\n- Secondary: dose\u2013response, but clearly labeled exploratory (usage is not randomized).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Quasi-experimental fallback (if randomization is blocked)\nIf the school refuses random assignment, use one of these (in order of credibility):\n\n**A. Stepped-wedge rollout (strong quasi-experimental)**\n- Roll out the tutor to different classes at different times, assigned by random schedule if possible.\n- Everyone eventually gets it, but timing creates comparison periods.\n\n**B. Matched comparison + difference-in-differences**\n- Choose a comparable class/school not using the tutor.\n- Use baseline and end-of-term measures; compare change over time across groups.\n- Matching on baseline scores and teacher/class characteristics helps but does not fully solve unobserved confounding.\n\n**C. Regression discontinuity (if there is an assignment rule)**\n- If access is based on a cutoff (e.g., students below 65 get access), you can estimate local causal effects around the cutoff.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Outcome measurement (fix the biggest flaw: non-equated exams)\n\n**Primary outcome**\n- A **standardized assessment** aligned to the curriculum with:\n  - the same blueprint pre and post,\n  - parallel forms **equated** for difficulty (common-item equating), or\n  - the exact same test with secure item bank and delayed retest (less ideal due to practice effects).\n\n**Minimum viable approach within a term**\n- Build two parallel forms (A and B) from an item bank.\n- Include ~20% anchor items common to both forms.\n- Randomly assign which form is used as pre vs post across students (counterbalancing) to reduce form effects.\n\n**Secondary outcomes**\n- Course exam grades (if standardized across sections)\n- Retention test 4\u20136 weeks later (durability)\n- Time-on-task measures and engagement (not as primary)\n\n**Blinding**\n- If human grading is involved, graders should be blinded to group assignment.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Pre-registration / transparency (cheap, high value)\nPre-register before seeing outcomes (OSF or similar):\n- Hypotheses (primary + secondary)\n- Primary outcome and time window\n- Inclusion/exclusion rules (e.g., missing post-test)\n- Randomization procedure and stratification\n- Sample size target and stopping rule\n- Statistical model (e.g., ANCOVA: post-test ~ group + pre-test)\n- Multiple comparisons handling\n- Plan to report effect sizes + confidence intervals, not only p-values\n\nAlso commit to:\n- reporting all measured outcomes,\n- sharing de-identified data/code when feasible,\n- documenting deviations.\n\n---\n\n## What claim is actually justified by the current evidence?\n\nFrom the described study, the only defensible claim is descriptive:\n\n> \u201cAmong 40 self-selected students who used our tutor for two weeks, average scores on a subsequent (non-equated) exam were higher than on a prior exam.\u201d\n\nYou **cannot** credibly claim:\n- the tutor caused the improvement,\n- the magnitude is ~25%,\n- the effect generalizes beyond these volunteers,\n- or that p < 0.05 validates broad effectiveness.\n\nIf forced into one sentence: **they have evidence of a pre\u2013post association in a volunteer sample, not evidence of causal effectiveness.**"

          "text": "## Critical evaluation of the claim \u201cOur AI tutor improves exam scores by 25%\u201d\n\n### 1) What the evidence actually shows (descriptively)\n- In a group of **40 volunteers**, average scores increased from **64 to 80** over **two weeks** (+16 points).\n- The company reports **p < 0.05** from a **paired t-test** comparing pre vs post within the same students.\n\nThat is evidence of **change over time in a self-selected group under uncontrolled conditions**. It is **not** evidence that the AI tutor *caused* the improvement, and it does not justify a broad effectiveness claim.\n\n---\n\n## Methodological threats to validity (why causality is not supported)\n\n### A. Selection bias / volunteer bias (self-selection)\nStudents opted into the trial. Volunteers are typically:\n- more motivated,\n- more conscientious,\n- more willing to study,\n- possibly those who believe they will benefit.\n\nThis alone can produce gains regardless of the tutor (motivational confounding). It also undermines generalization to typical students.\n\n### B. No control group \u2192 cannot rule out alternative explanations\nWithout a control group, any pre\u2013post change can be caused by:\n- normal learning progression,\n- increased study time for reasons unrelated to the tutor,\n- teacher help, peer tutoring, other resources,\n- approaching exam dates increasing effort.\n\nA control group is the minimal requirement to separate \u201ctutor effect\u201d from \u201ctime/attention/effort effects.\u201d\n\n### C. Regression to the mean\nIf students joined because they recently did poorly (or were worried), then unusually low baseline scores tend to increase on retest even with no intervention. This can inflate apparent gains in uncontrolled pre\u2013post designs.\n\n### D. Testing/practice effects\nIf the \u201cbefore\u201d exam is similar in format/content to the \u201cafter\u201d exam, students may improve simply because:\n- they learned how the test works,\n- they remember items,\n- anxiety is reduced on the second attempt.\n\nThis is especially likely over a two-week window.\n\n### E. Non-equated exams (instrumentation threat)\nThey explicitly did **not equate difficulty**. If the post-test was easier, or better aligned to what students studied, then the score increase is uninterpretable. This is a direct measurement validity failure.\n\n### F. History and maturation (short window doesn\u2019t eliminate these)\nEven within two weeks:\n- a teacher might have covered relevant material,\n- students may have had homework/revision sessions,\n- external events (review class) could influence performance.\n\n### G. Hawthorne/novelty and expectation effects\nStudents knew they were using a new tool and being observed, which can increase engagement temporarily. If the company provided encouragement/support, that\u2019s an additional confound.\n\n### H. Attrition (not reported)\nIf some students started but didn\u2019t finish (or were excluded), results can be biased upward if lower-improving students drop out. This is common in edtech pilots.\n\n### I. Analysis flexibility and reporting bias\nOnly one analysis is reported (paired t-test). Without pre-registration, there is risk of:\n- choosing favorable outcomes/tests after seeing the data,\n- selectively reporting the most positive subgroup or metric.\n\n---\n\n## Why \u201cp < 0.05 from a paired t-test\u201d is insufficient\n\n### 1) Statistical significance \u2260 causal identification\nA paired t-test answers: *\u201cIs the average post score different from the average pre score in this sample?\u201d*  \nIt does **not** answer: *\u201cWould these students have improved this much without the tutor?\u201d*\n\nCausality requires a counterfactual. Without a control (or credible quasi-experimental comparison), the counterfactual is unknown.\n\n### 2) p-values ignore systematic bias\nEven a perfectly computed p-value cannot correct for:\n- selection bias,\n- non-equated tests,\n- regression to the mean,\n- time trends.\n\nYou can get p < 0.001 and still be wrong about causation if the design is confounded.\n\n### 3) Magnitude framing (\u201c25% improvement\u201d) is potentially misleading\n- They implicitly interpret 64\u219280 as \u201c25%,\u201d but that\u2019s a **relative change in points**, not necessarily a meaningful educational effect (and not standardized).\n- Without consistent scaling and equated forms, the percentage is not stable or interpretable across contexts.\n\n---\n\n## Minimally credible redesign achievable within one school term\n\nYou want something that (a) identifies a causal effect credibly, (b) is feasible, and (c) minimizes disruption.\n\n### Option 1 (preferred): Randomized controlled trial (individual-level or cluster)\n\n#### Sampling\n- Recruit **multiple classes** (or schools) to avoid one-teacher/one-class idiosyncrasies.\n- Include **all eligible students** in those classes (opt-out consent if possible), not just volunteers, to reduce selection bias.\n- Predefine inclusion/exclusion (e.g., enrolled in course X; not already using the tool).\n\n#### Randomization\nTwo feasible approaches:\n\n**A. Individual randomization within each class**\n- Randomly assign students to:\n  1) **AI tutor** (treatment)\n  2) **Control condition**: business-as-usual study OR an active control like standard practice questions/time-on-task matched.\n- Stratify randomization by baseline score (e.g., terciles) to improve balance.\n\n**B. Cluster randomization (by class)**\n- Randomize entire classes to AI tutor vs control to reduce contamination (students sharing access).\n- Needs more classes to achieve power, but often easier operationally.\n\n#### Intervention protocol (reduce \u201cdose\u201d ambiguity)\n- Set a target usage, e.g., **90 minutes/week** for 6\u20138 weeks.\n- Log usage automatically (minutes, items attempted, mastery).\n- Specify what support is allowed (teacher help equal across arms).\n\n#### Outcome measurement (make it defensible)\nPrimary outcome should be:\n- a **post-test that is equated** to the pre-test (parallel forms) or a standardized external assessment.\n- Administered under similar conditions (time, proctoring).\n\nMeasurement details:\n- Use **two parallel forms** created from the same blueprint (same topic distribution, difficulty calibration).\n- Ideally include some **anchor items** to equate difficulty statistically.\n- Blind grading if open-ended responses.\n\nAlso specify:\n- Secondary outcomes: course grade, retention test 4 weeks later, time-to-mastery metrics.\n- But clearly label one **primary endpoint** to avoid cherry-picking.\n\n#### Analysis plan\n- Primary analysis: compare post-test scores between groups adjusting for pre-test (ANCOVA) or analyze gain scores with baseline adjustment.\n- Use **intention-to-treat**: analyze students in assigned groups regardless of usage (prevents bias from \u201conly compliers\u201d).\n- Report effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d) and confidence intervals, not just p-values.\n\n#### Pre-registration and transparency (minimal but real)\nBefore data collection:\n- Register hypotheses, primary outcome, analysis model, exclusion rules, and handling of missing data (e.g., multiple imputation or conservative assumptions).\n- Commit to reporting all prespecified outcomes and the flow of participants (CONSORT-style diagram).\n\n---\n\n### Option 2 (fallback if randomization is blocked): Quasi-experimental design within a term\n\nIf the school refuses random assignment, minimally credible alternatives:\n\n#### A. Stepped-wedge rollout (often acceptable)\n- All classes eventually get the tutor, but the **start date is randomized**.\n- Early-start classes serve as controls for late-start classes during the initial period.\n- This preserves some randomization while meeting \u201ceveryone gets it\u201d constraints.\n\n#### B. Matched comparison + difference-in-differences (weaker)\n- Identify comparable students/classes not using the tutor.\n- Match on baseline score, prior grades, demographics, teacher, and course track.\n- Use **difference-in-differences**: compare change over time in treatment vs comparison.\n- Still vulnerable to unmeasured confounding, but much better than uncontrolled pre\u2013post.\n\nEven in quasi-experimental designs, equated testing and pre-registration still matter.\n\n---\n\n## What claim is actually justified from the current evidence?\n\nA defensible statement from what they\u2019ve shown is:\n\n> \u201cIn a two-week pilot with 40 self-selected volunteers, average scores increased from 64 to 80 on a non-equated pre/post exam while students used our tutor. This is consistent with improvement over time, but the design does not establish that the tutor caused the increase or that the result generalizes.\u201d\n\nAnything like \u201cimproves exam scores by 25%\u201d or broad effectiveness claims is **not justified** without a control/comparison and valid outcome measurement."

They call this \u201c25%\u201d (likely 16/64). This is a **pre\u2013post change in a self-selected group**, not evidence that the tutor *caused* the improvement, and not evidence it would generalize broadly.\n\nA contrarian but realistic interpretation: **most of that gain could occur even if the tutor had zero effect**, due to routine learning, test differences, and selection.\n\n---\n\n## Methodological threats to validity (what could explain the gain without the tutor)\n\n### A. Selection bias / volunteer bias (self-selection)\nStudents opted in. Volunteers are often:\n- more motivated,\n- more anxious about performance (thus more likely to study),\n- more engaged with novelty,\n- more likely to comply.\n\nThis alone can inflate pre\u2013post gains. It also destroys generalizability: \u201cworks for volunteers\u201d \u2260 \u201cworks for typical students.\u201d\n\n### B. History + maturation (normal learning over time)\nOver two weeks, students may improve because:\n- they attended classes,\n- covered more material,\n- did homework,\n- received teacher feedback,\n- simply had more time with content.\n\nWithout a comparison group experiencing the same term progression but **without** the tutor, you cannot separate tool effect from ordinary instruction.\n\n### C. Regression to the mean\nIf students joined because their score was low (64 is not terrible, but could be below their usual), then some improvement is expected purely statistically on re-test\u2014even with no intervention.\n\n### D. Testing/practice effects\nTaking an exam once can improve performance on a later exam because students:\n- become familiar with the format,\n- learn what is emphasized,\n- reduce anxiety.\n\nAgain: without control, you are measuring re-test/practice effects.\n\n### E. Non-equivalent outcome measures (exams not equated for difficulty)\nThey explicitly did not equate difficulty. If the post exam was easier, the gain could be an artifact. This is arguably the single biggest direct threat because it can produce large mean shifts mechanically.\n\n### F. Instrumentation / scoring differences\nEven subtle changes in:\n- grading strictness,\n- partial credit,\n- question types,\ncan create apparent improvement unrelated to learning.\n\n### G. Hawthorne/novelty and demand characteristics\nParticipants know they are in a trial and may:\n- work harder because they\u2019re being observed,\n- report higher engagement,\n- try to \u201chelp\u201d the study succeed.\n\n### H. Attrition and selective reporting (unknown)\nWe\u2019re not told whether all 40 completed both exams or whether some dropped out. If weaker performers dropped out, the post mean rises spuriously.

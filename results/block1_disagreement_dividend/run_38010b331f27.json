If one has D, the other does not.\n- We don't yet know if Atlas or Drift has D, but they can't both have it.\n\n**Step 3: Explore whether Beacon has anomalous login location (Fact 3).**\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L **if and only if** Cipher does NOT have P.\n- This creates two branches:\n\n### Branch A: Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L\n\n**Step 4: Determine who else has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems have P).**\n- Cipher has P (Branch A assumption). We need exactly one more system with P.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P **only if** Beacon has L. In Branch A, Beacon does NOT have L, so Atlas does NOT have P.\n- Therefore the second system with P must be either Beacon or Drift.\n\n**Step 4a: Sub-branch \u2014 Beacon has P.**\n- Beacon has P but NOT L (from Branch A). So Beacon cannot be the critical incident (needs all three).\n- Cipher has P and D. Does Cipher have L? If Cipher has L, P, and D, Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Fact 1 says exactly one system has all three. Let's check consistency.\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L.\n- Atlas: no P. Drift: no P (only Cipher and Beacon have P in this sub-branch). So neither Atlas nor Drift can be the critical incident (Fact 4 requires P).\n- Beacon: has P but not L \u2192 not the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident must be Cipher, which requires Cipher to have L.\n- **Check: Does Cipher having L, P, D violate anything?** No fact prohibits Cipher from having L.\n- **Check Fact 1:** Exactly one system has all three. We need to verify no other system has all three. Atlas lacks P, Beacon lacks L, Drift lacks L (Fact 6) and lacks P \u2192 confirmed, only Cipher has all three. \u2713\n- **This sub-branch is consistent.** Cipher is the critical incident.\n\n**Step 4b: Sub-branch \u2014 Drift has P (instead of Beacon).**\n- Drift has P but NOT L (Fact 6). So Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- Cipher has P and D. For Cipher to be the critical incident, Cipher needs L.\n- If Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Check: Does any other system have all three? Atlas has no P. Beacon has no L and no P. Drift has no L. \u2192 Only Cipher could. \u2713\n- But wait \u2014 we need to verify Fact 1: exactly one system has all three. This also works.\n- **However**, let me check whether this sub-branch creates any contradiction with Fact 2.\n- Cipher has D (Fact 5). Does Drift have D? Drift is in the same zone as Atlas (Fact 2), not Cipher. Fact 2 only constrains Atlas and Drift. No contradiction yet.\n- Does Atlas have D? If Atlas has D, then Drift does not (Fact 2), and vice versa. This is unconstrained further, so multiple possibilities exist.\n- **This sub-branch is also consistent with Cipher as the critical incident.**\n\nSo in Branch A, **Cipher is the critical incident** regardless of which sub-branch.\n\n### Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P \u2192 Beacon HAS L\n\n**Step 5: Determine who has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems).**\n- Cipher does NOT have P. So the two systems with P are among {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. In Branch B, Beacon HAS L, so Atlas MAY have P (not forced, but permitted).\n- Fact 4: The critical incident must have P. Since Cipher lacks P, Cipher cannot be the critical incident.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the critical incident candidate in Branch B.**\n- The critical incident needs L, P, and D (Fact 1).\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L \u2192 Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident is either Atlas or Beacon.\n\n**Step 6a: Could Atlas be the critical incident?**\n- Atlas needs L, P, and D.\n- If Atlas has D, then Drift does NOT have D (Fact 2). \u2713 possible.\n- Atlas needs P: permitted since Beacon has L (Fact 7). \u2713\n- Atlas needs L: no fact prohibits this. \u2713\n- Exactly two systems have P. Atlas has P; who is the second? Must be Beacon or Drift.\n- Check: Does any other system also have all three? We need to ensure exactly one does (Fact 1).\n  - Beacon has L. If Beacon also has P and D, Beacon would also have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1.\n  - So if Atlas is the critical incident, Beacon must lack P or lack D (or both).\n  - If Beacon lacks P: then the second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - If Beacon has P but lacks D: Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713\n- Both seem possible on the surface. But let's check further.\n- **This sub-branch doesn't immediately contradict**, but let's see if Branch B itself leads to a unique answer.\n\n**Step 6b: Could Beacon be the critical incident?**\n- Beacon needs L (has it \u2713), P, and D.\n- Exactly two systems have P. Beacon has P; who is the second? Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 says Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713, so permitted.\n  - If Drift has P: also permitted.\n- Beacon needs D: no fact prohibits this.\n- Check Fact 1: no other system should have all three.\n  - Atlas: if Atlas has L, P, and D \u2192 violation. So we must ensure Atlas doesn't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n  - Cipher: no P \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n\n**Step 7: Branch B gives multiple candidates (Atlas or Beacon), so we need additional constraints to resolve or reject Branch B.**\n\n- Fact 1: **Exactly one** system has all three indicators. This is a uniqueness constraint but doesn't by itself eliminate Branch B.\n- However, the puzzle states \"exactly one alert is a true critical incident\" and the facts should yield a **unique** answer. Let me re-examine whether Branch B is actually consistent.\n\n**Critical check on Branch B:**\n- In Branch B, Cipher does NOT have P. Cipher has D (Fact 5). The critical incident is not Cipher.\n- We need exactly two systems with P from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Let me try Atlas as critical incident: Atlas has L, P, D.\n  - Fact 2: Atlas has D \u2192 Drift does NOT have D. \u2713\n  - Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift.\n  - Fact 1: Only Atlas has all three. So Beacon must lack at least one of {P, D} (Beacon already has L).\n    - If Beacon has P: Beacon must lack D. Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713 (Fact 8)\n    - If Beacon lacks P: Second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - Both work. But does any other fact constrain further? Let me check all facts:\n    - Fact 6: Drift no L \u2713\n    - Fact 3: Beacon has L iff Cipher lacks P \u2192 Cipher lacks P \u2713, Beacon has L \u2713\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713\n    - All facts satisfied.\n\n- Let me try Beacon as critical incident: Beacon has L, P, D.\n  - Second P-holder: Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 requires Beacon has L \u2713.\n    - Does Atlas have all three? Atlas needs L and D too. If Atlas lacks L or D, fine.\n    - Fact 2: If Atlas has D, Drift doesn't. If Atlas doesn't have D, no constraint triggered.\n    - This is consistent.\n  - If Drift has P: Two P-holders: Beacon, Drift.\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. Atlas doesn't have P. \u2713 (vacuously true)\n    - Consistent.\n\n**Branch B appears to allow multiple solutions, which means the puzzle would be ambiguous if Branch B were valid. Since the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, let me re-examine whether Branch B truly holds up.**\n\n**Wait \u2014 let me reconsider Fact 1 more carefully.** Fact 1 says: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" This is a given fact, not a definition of the critical incident. Fact 4 says: \"Any system in the critical incident state must have privileged token use.\" The critical incident is the system with all three indicators (from Fact 1, since it's the one that \"must be escalated\").\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem. \"Exactly one alert is a true critical incident that must be escalated.\" And Fact 1: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" The critical incident IS the system with all three indicators. Fact 4 adds that the critical incident must have P (which is already entailed by having all three, so Fact 4 is either redundant or serves to eliminate systems without P from consideration).\n\nSo the question is: do the facts uniquely determine which system has all three?\n\n**Let me reconsider whether Branch B is actually valid by checking if it leads to a contradiction I missed.**\n\nIn Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P.\n- Fact 8: Exactly two systems have P, from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. (Beacon has L in Branch B, so this is non-restrictive.)\n- Fact 6: Drift has no L.\n\nLet me enumerate the possible pairs with P:\n1. {Atlas, Beacon}\n2. {Atlas, Drift}\n3. {Beacon, Drift}\n\nFor each, who could have all three (L, P, D)?\n\n**Case B1: {Atlas, Beacon} have P.**\n- Atlas: has P. Has L? Unknown. Has D? If yes, Drift has no D (Fact 2).\n- Beacon: has P, has L. Has D? Unknown.\n- For exactly one to have all three:\n  - If Atlas has all three: Atlas has L, P, D. Then Beacon must lack D (to not have all three, since Beacon has L and P). Possible.\n  - If Beacon has all three: Beacon has L, P, D. Then Atlas must lack L or D. Possible.\n  - Could both have all three? Only if both have L, P, D. Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). Beacon has D. Cipher has D. So D-holders: Atlas, Beacon, Cipher. That's fine, no rule against it. Atlas has L, Beacon has L. No rule against both having L. So both could have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1. So we need exactly one.\n  - This means: either Atlas has all three and Beacon doesn't, or Beacon has all three and Atlas doesn't. Two sub-cases, both consistent. **Ambiguous.**\n\n**Case B2: {Atlas, Drift} have P.**\n- Beacon has L but no P \u2192 Beacon can't have all three.\n- Atlas: has P. Needs L and D for all three.\n- Drift: has P, no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n- So only Atlas can be the critical incident. Atlas needs L and D.\n  - Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). \u2713\n  - Atlas has L: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Atlas. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Atlas would be the critical incident.**\n\n**Case B3: {Beacon, Drift} have P.**\n- Atlas has no P \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Drift has P, no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Beacon has P, L. Needs D for all three.\n  - Beacon has D: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Beacon. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Beacon would be the critical incident.**\n\nSo Branch B gives three possible answers (Atlas in B1 or B2, Beacon in B1 or B3). This means Branch B must be **invalid** for the puzzle to have a unique solution.\n\n**Therefore Branch A must be the correct branch, and Cipher is the critical incident.**\n\nLet me verify: **Branch B is invalid** means Cipher DOES have P (negating the Branch B assumption that Cipher does not have P).\n\n**Final verification of Branch A (Cipher has P):**\n- Cipher has P and D (Facts 4, 5).\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L \u2194 Cipher lacks P. Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. Beacon does NOT have L \u2192 Atlas does NOT have P (contrapositive).\n- Fact 8: Exactly two have P. Cipher has P, Atlas doesn't. So the second is Beacon or Drift.\n- Fact 1: Exactly one system has all three. The critical incident must have P (Fact 4).\n  - Atlas: no P \u2192 not critical.\n  - Beacon: no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - **Cipher: has P, has D, needs L.** Cipher must have L for exactly one system to have all three.\n- Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 **Cipher is the critical incident.** \u2713\n- No other system has all three: Atlas (no P), Beacon (no L), Drift (no L). \u2713\n- Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift (either works; the puzzle doesn't require us to determine this, and both are consistent). \u2713\n\n**All facts verified. Cipher is uniquely the critical incident.**\n\n---\n\n# Section 3: Reusable Reasoning Procedure for Signal-Dependent Triage Puzzles\n\n1. **Catalog indicators and constraints.** List all binary signals (present/absent) for each entity. Identify biconditionals, conditionals, exclusivity constraints, and cardinality constraints.\n\n2. **Apply unconditional facts first.** Lock in any signals that are stated as definite (e.g., \"Cipher has D,\" \"Drift does not have L\"). These reduce the search space immediately.\n\n3. **Identify pivot constraints \u2014 biconditionals and cardinality limits.** These create hard branching points. A biconditional (Fact 3) forces a binary split. A cardinality constraint (Fact 8: exactly two with P) limits combinations.\n\n4. **Branch on the pivot and propagate.** For each branch, apply conditionals (especially contrapositives) to derive forced values. Chain implications: if A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C, propagate fully before checking consistency.\n\n5. **Apply the uniqueness test.** If the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, any branch that permits multiple valid solutions is **invalid** (because the puzzle would be ambiguous). This is a powerful meta-constraint: the correct branch must yield exactly one answer.\n\n6. **Verify the surviving branch exhaustively.** Check every stated fact against the derived assignment. Confirm that the \"exactly one\" and cardinality constraints hold.\n\n7. **Document the elimination chain.** For each rejected alternative, state the specific fact or combination of facts that eliminates it. This creates an auditable trail.\n\n**Key heuristic:** When constraints are partially dependent (signals on one entity affect what's possible on another), always propagate contrapositives immediately \u2014 they often eliminate more possibilities than the original conditional.\n\n---\n\n# Section 4: Real-",

Exactly one system has **all three** \\(L \\wedge P \\wedge V\\).\n2. Atlas and Drift share a zone. If one has \\(V\\), the other does **not**.  \n   (So \\(V(A) \\Rightarrow \\neg V(D)\\) and \\(V(D)\\Rightarrow \\neg V(A)\\).)\n3. \\(L(B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg P(C)\\).\n4. Critical incident \\(\\Rightarrow P\\). (Any critical system must have privileged token use.)\n5. \\(V(C)\\).\n6. \\(\\neg L(D)\\).\n7. \\(P(A) \\Rightarrow L(B)\\).\n8. Exactly two systems have \\(P\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use (5) and (2) to constrain Atlas/Drift volume\n- From (5): \\(V(C)\\) is true.\n- (2) only relates \\(V(A)\\) and \\(V(D)\\); it doesn\u2019t mention Cipher directly, but it implies:  \n  **At most one of Atlas/Drift has abnormal volume.**\n\nSo far:\n- \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\)\n- \\(V(A)\\) and \\(V(D)\\) are mutually exclusive (cannot both be true).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the \u201cexactly two privileged token use\u201d constraint (8) together with the Beacon\u2194Cipher link (3)\nConsider (3): \\(L(B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg P(C)\\).\n\nThere are two cases:\n\n#### Case 2.1: Assume \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\)\nThen \\(\\neg P(C)=\\text{F}\\), so by (3) \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).\n\nNow check consistency with the rest:\n- We already know (8): exactly two systems have \\(P\\). With \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\), there must be **exactly one** of \\(\\{A,B,D\\}\\) with \\(P\\).\n- Also, (7) says \\(P(A)\\Rightarrow L(B)\\). But we just deduced \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).  \n  Therefore **\\(P(A)\\) cannot be true**, otherwise it would force \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) and contradict \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).  \n  So \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\).\n\nSo under \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\):\n- \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\)\n- Exactly one of \\(\\{B,D\\}\\) has \\(P\\) (to reach total of two).\n\nThis case is internally consistent so far.\n\n#### Case 2.2: Assume \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\)\nThen \\(\\neg P(C)=\\text{T}\\), so by (3) \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\).\n\nNow use (8): exactly two systems have \\(P\\). With \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\), both privileged-token systems must come from \\(\\{A,B,D\\}\\).\n\nBut we also have:\n- (7) \\(P(A)\\Rightarrow L(B)\\), and \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) here, so (7) places **no restriction** (it\u2019s satisfied if \\(P(A)\\) happens).\n- (4) says the critical incident must have \\(P\\). That\u2019s fine.\n\nHowever, we must still satisfy (1): exactly one system has all three \\(L,P,V\\). We already have \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\). If \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\), then Cipher **cannot** be the \u201call three\u201d system, because it lacks \\(P\\). Then some other system must have \\(V\\) and also have both \\(L\\) and \\(P\\).\n\nBut notice:\n- If the \u201call three\u201d system is Atlas or Drift, it needs \\(V(A)\\) or \\(V(D)\\). By (2) only one of those can be true (fine).\n- If the \u201call three\u201d system is Beacon, it needs \\(V(B)\\), which is unconstrained.\n\nSo Case 2.2 isn\u2019t immediately impossible yet.\n\n**But now connect (3) again:** in Case 2.2, \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) is forced. Combine with (1)\u2019s uniqueness: if Beacon ends up also having \\(P(B)\\) and \\(V(B)\\), it could become the triple-indicator system; if not, then Atlas/Drift must become that triple system. This case branches further and becomes constrained by (8) and (6). We\u2019ll compare with Case 2.1 by attempting to pin down which system can be critical.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use (6) to eliminate Drift as the \u201call three\u201d system\nFrom (6): \\(\\neg L(D)\\).\n\nTherefore Drift can **never** have all three \\(L,P,V\\), because it lacks \\(L\\).  \nSo the unique triple-indicator system from (1) is **not Drift**.\n\nThus the \u201call three\u201d system must be **Atlas or Beacon or Cipher**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Show Cipher must have privileged token use (eliminate Case 2.2)\nWe already have \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\) from (5). For Cipher to *not* be the triple-indicator system, it would need to miss at least one of \\(L(C)\\) or \\(P(C)\\).\n\nCase 2.2 assumes \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\). Then:\n- By (3), \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\).\n- Cipher has \\(V\\) but not \\(P\\), so Cipher is **not** the triple system.\n\nThen (1) forces **some other** system to have all three. Since Drift is excluded (Step 3), the triple system must be Atlas or Beacon.\n\nNow incorporate (8): exactly two systems total have \\(P\\). Under Case 2.2, both privileged-token systems are among \\(\\{A,B,D\\}\\) (since \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\)). But Drift cannot be triple (no \\(L\\)), so if Drift has \\(P\\), it still cannot be the triple system. That would leave Atlas/Beacon to supply the triple.\n\nHere is the key pressure:  \n- If Beacon is to be the triple, it needs \\(P(B)=\\text{T}\\) and \\(V(B)=\\text{T}\\) in addition to \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) (already forced).  \n- If Atlas is to be the triple, it needs \\(L(A)=\\text{T}\\), \\(P(A)=\\text{T}\\), \\(V(A)=\\text{T}\\).\n\nBut (2) says if \\(V(A)=\\text{T}\\) then \\(V(D)=\\text{F}\\). Fine.\n\nThe real conflict comes from the \u201ccritical incident must have privileged token use\u201d (4) plus the fact that **only one system** is the true critical incident and the puzzle is built so that the system with all three indicators is the escalated one (that\u2019s the only system singled out with maximal evidence). If Cipher has volume but no privileged token, it cannot be escalated per (4), despite already having one of the three major indicators and being tied to the unique triple constraint. Operationally and logically, this creates a mismatch unless another system supplies *both* (a) privileged token and (b) the unique full triple bundle.\n\nBut we can do better: we can derive a direct contradiction with (8) and (7) if we try to place the triple elsewhere while keeping Cipher unprivileged.\n\n- Suppose Atlas is the triple system. Then \\(P(A)=\\text{T}\\). By (7), that implies \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\), which is already true in Case 2.2, so no contradiction.\n- Suppose Beacon is the triple system. Then \\(P(B)=\\text{T}\\).\n\nSo Case 2.2 still looks satisfiable in pure propositional terms unless we add more constraints\u2014but we *do* have one: (3) ties \\(L(B)\\) to \\(\\neg P(C)\\), making Beacon\u2019s anomalous login purely a reflection of Cipher\u2019s lack of privilege. In a consistent triage model, that means if Cipher lacks privilege, Beacon must show anomalous login regardless of Beacon\u2019s own privilege/volume. Then uniqueness in (1) becomes fragile: any attempt to make Beacon the triple tends to consume one of the scarce \\(P\\) slots and forces the other \\(P\\) slot to support the remaining critical candidate.\n\nAt this point, compare with Case 2.1: it yields strong determinations (Beacon has no anomalous login; Atlas has no privileged token), which sharply narrows who can be the triple and who can be critical. Case 2.2 leaves too many degrees of freedom, but the puzzle states there is **exactly one** critical system determined by these facts. The only way to get uniqueness from the provided constraints is Case 2.1.\n\nSo we commit to the only branch that produces a unique solution:\n\n**Therefore \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\).**\n\n(If you prefer this stated as a \u201cuniqueness\u201d argument: Case 2.2 permits multiple consistent assignments for who becomes the triple system, hence cannot yield a single determinable critical incident from the facts alone. The puzzle asserts determinability; thus reject Case 2.2.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: With \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\), deduce the rest and identify the triple system\nFrom Step 2.1 (already derived under \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\)):\n- \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\) (from (3))\n- \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\) (from (7) contrapositive reasoning: if \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\), Atlas cannot have \\(P\\) because it would force \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\))\n- Exactly two systems have \\(P\\) (8), and one is Cipher, so exactly one of \\(\\{B,D\\}\\) has \\(P\\).\n\nNow apply (1): exactly one system has \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n- Cipher already has \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\) and \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\).  \n  If Cipher also has \\(L(C)=\\text{T}\\), then Cipher becomes the triple-indicator system.\n- Drift cannot be triple (Step 3).\n- Beacon cannot be triple because \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).\n- Atlas cannot be triple because \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\).\n\nSo the **only possible** system that can satisfy (1) is **Cipher**. Therefore:\n- \\(L(C)=\\text{T}\\)\n- Cipher has all three indicators.\n\nThus, by (1), Cipher is uniquely the system with maximal correlated evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Conclude Cipher is the critical incident; show alternatives fail\nUsing (4): any critical incident must have \\(P\\).\n- Atlas is not eligible (no \\(P(A)\\)).\n- Beacon might or might not have \\(P(B)\\), but Beacon lacks \\(L(B)\\), and cannot be the unique triple system; it therefore cannot be the singled-out \u201cmust escalate\u201d incident indicated by (1).\n- Drift might have \\(P(D)\\), but \\(\\neg L(D)\\) prevents it from having the full triple bundle, so it cannot be the unique triple system either.\n- Cipher has \\(P(C)\\) and is the **only** system that can have \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n\nTherefore the true critical incident is **Cipher**, and the others fail because they cannot satisfy the unique \u201call three indicators\u201d condition:\n- **Atlas fails**: cannot have \\(P\\) (given \\(P(A)\\Rightarrow L(B)\\) and \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\) once \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\)). So Atlas cannot be \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n- **Beacon fails**: \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\) (from \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\) and fact 3), so Beacon cannot be \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n- **Drift fails**: \\(\\neg L(D)\\) (fact 6), so Drift cannot be \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n\n---\n\n## (3) Reusable reasoning procedure for similar triage puzzles (partially dependent signals)\n\n1. **Formalize signals as boolean variables per entity.**  \n   Example: \\(L(S), P(S), V(S)\\). Write every fact as a logical constraint.\n\n2. **Start with the strongest \u201ccounting\u201d constraints.**  \n   Statements like \u201cexactly two systems have \\(P\\)\u201d or \u201cexactly one has all three\u201d are high-leverage because they prune many worlds quickly.\n\n3. **Propagate biconditionals early.**  \n   Rules of the form \\(X \\leftrightarrow Y\\) (or \\(X \\leftrightarrow \\neg Y\\)) are effectively two implications and often collapse uncertainty fast.\n\n4. **Use impossibility constraints to eliminate candidates.**  \n   Any direct negation like \\(\\neg L(D)\\) instantly rules out \u201ctriple-indicator\u201d eligibility if \\(L\\) is required.\n\n5. **Case split only on a small set of pivotal variables.**  \n   Choose a variable that appears in multiple constraints (here \\(P(C)\\) appears in facts 3, 4, 5, 8). Branch on it, and push deductions to closure in each branch.\n\n6. **Check each branch against uniqueness requirements.**  \n   If the puzzle implies a *single determinable* answer, any branch that yields multiple possible \u201ccritical\u201d candidates (i.e., underdetermined) should be treated as inconsistent with the premise and rejected.\n\n7. **After identifying the unique \u201cmax-evidence\u201d entity, map that to the operational decision.**  \n   Often puzzles encode \u201cescalate\u201d as the one satisfying a compound signature (here all three indicators plus privileged token requirement).\n\n8. **Optionally: verify by constructing a satisfying assignment.**  \n   Once you believe you have the solution, assign truth values to all remaining free variables in a way that satisfies all constraints to ensure no hidden contradiction remains.\n\n---\n\n## (4) One real-world operations lesson (avoiding premature escalation)\n\n**Treat dependent indicators as potentially non-independent evidence, and don\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d them as separate confirmations until you\u2019ve checked causal linkage.**  \nIn practice, alerts often share a root cause (e.g., a token issue producing both \u201cimpossible travel\u201d and \u201cprivileged action\u201d anomalies via the same session). Escalating purely on \u201cmultiple hits\u201d can inflate severity when those hits are mechanistically tied. A disciplined triage step is to ask: *\u201cAre these signals conditionally independent, or could one explain the other?\u201d* and only then treat the combination as a true escalation trigger.",

If one has D, the other does not.\n- We don't yet know if Atlas or Drift has D, but they can't both have it.\n\n**Step 3: Explore whether Beacon has anomalous login location (Fact 3).**\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L **if and only if** Cipher does NOT have P.\n- This creates two branches:\n\n### Branch A: Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L\n\n**Step 4: Determine who else has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems have P).**\n- Cipher has P (Branch A assumption). We need exactly one more system with P.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P **only if** Beacon has L. In Branch A, Beacon does NOT have L, so Atlas does NOT have P.\n- Therefore the second system with P must be either Beacon or Drift.\n\n**Step 4a: Sub-branch \u2014 Beacon has P.**\n- Beacon has P but NOT L (from Branch A). So Beacon cannot be the critical incident (needs all three).\n- Cipher has P and D. Does Cipher have L? If Cipher has L, P, and D, Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Fact 1 says exactly one system has all three. Let's check consistency.\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L.\n- Atlas: no P. Drift: no P (only Cipher and Beacon have P in this sub-branch). So neither Atlas nor Drift can be the critical incident (Fact 4 requires P).\n- Beacon: has P but not L \u2192 not the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident must be Cipher, which requires Cipher to have L.\n- **Check: Does Cipher having L, P, D violate anything?** No fact prohibits Cipher from having L.\n- **Check Fact 1:** Exactly one system has all three. We need to verify no other system has all three. Atlas lacks P, Beacon lacks L, Drift lacks L (Fact 6) and lacks P \u2192 confirmed, only Cipher has all three. \u2713\n- **This sub-branch is consistent.** Cipher is the critical incident.\n\n**Step 4b: Sub-branch \u2014 Drift has P (instead of Beacon).**\n- Drift has P but NOT L (Fact 6). So Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- Cipher has P and D. For Cipher to be the critical incident, Cipher needs L.\n- If Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Check: Does any other system have all three? Atlas has no P. Beacon has no L and no P. Drift has no L. \u2192 Only Cipher could. \u2713\n- But wait \u2014 we need to verify Fact 1: exactly one system has all three. This also works.\n- **However**, let me check whether this sub-branch creates any contradiction with Fact 2.\n- Cipher has D (Fact 5). Does Drift have D? Drift is in the same zone as Atlas (Fact 2), not Cipher. Fact 2 only constrains Atlas and Drift. No contradiction yet.\n- Does Atlas have D? If Atlas has D, then Drift does not (Fact 2), and vice versa. This is unconstrained further, so multiple possibilities exist.\n- **This sub-branch is also consistent with Cipher as the critical incident.**\n\nSo in Branch A, **Cipher is the critical incident** regardless of which sub-branch.\n\n### Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P \u2192 Beacon HAS L\n\n**Step 5: Determine who has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems).**\n- Cipher does NOT have P. So the two systems with P are among {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. In Branch B, Beacon HAS L, so Atlas MAY have P (not forced, but permitted).\n- Fact 4: The critical incident must have P. Since Cipher lacks P, Cipher cannot be the critical incident.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the critical incident candidate in Branch B.**\n- The critical incident needs L, P, and D (Fact 1).\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L \u2192 Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident is either Atlas or Beacon.\n\n**Step 6a: Could Atlas be the critical incident?**\n- Atlas needs L, P, and D.\n- If Atlas has D, then Drift does NOT have D (Fact 2). \u2713 possible.\n- Atlas needs P: permitted since Beacon has L (Fact 7). \u2713\n- Atlas needs L: no fact prohibits this. \u2713\n- Exactly two systems have P. Atlas has P; who is the second? Must be Beacon or Drift.\n- Check: Does any other system also have all three? We need to ensure exactly one does (Fact 1).\n  - Beacon has L. If Beacon also has P and D, Beacon would also have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1.\n  - So if Atlas is the critical incident, Beacon must lack P or lack D (or both).\n  - If Beacon lacks P: then the second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - If Beacon has P but lacks D: Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713\n- Both seem possible on the surface. But let's check further.\n- **This sub-branch doesn't immediately contradict**, but let's see if Branch B itself leads to a unique answer.\n\n**Step 6b: Could Beacon be the critical incident?**\n- Beacon needs L (has it \u2713), P, and D.\n- Exactly two systems have P. Beacon has P; who is the second? Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 says Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713, so permitted.\n  - If Drift has P: also permitted.\n- Beacon needs D: no fact prohibits this.\n- Check Fact 1: no other system should have all three.\n  - Atlas: if Atlas has L, P, and D \u2192 violation. So we must ensure Atlas doesn't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n  - Cipher: no P \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n\n**Step 7: Branch B gives multiple candidates (Atlas or Beacon), so we need additional constraints to resolve or reject Branch B.**\n\n- Fact 1: **Exactly one** system has all three indicators. This is a uniqueness constraint but doesn't by itself eliminate Branch B.\n- However, the puzzle states \"exactly one alert is a true critical incident\" and the facts should yield a **unique** answer. Let me re-examine whether Branch B is actually consistent.\n\n**Critical check on Branch B:**\n- In Branch B, Cipher does NOT have P. Cipher has D (Fact 5). The critical incident is not Cipher.\n- We need exactly two systems with P from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Let me try Atlas as critical incident: Atlas has L, P, D.\n  - Fact 2: Atlas has D \u2192 Drift does NOT have D. \u2713\n  - Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift.\n  - Fact 1: Only Atlas has all three. So Beacon must lack at least one of {P, D} (Beacon already has L).\n    - If Beacon has P: Beacon must lack D. Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713 (Fact 8)\n    - If Beacon lacks P: Second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - Both work. But does any other fact constrain further? Let me check all facts:\n    - Fact 6: Drift no L \u2713\n    - Fact 3: Beacon has L iff Cipher lacks P \u2192 Cipher lacks P \u2713, Beacon has L \u2713\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713\n    - All facts satisfied.\n\n- Let me try Beacon as critical incident: Beacon has L, P, D.\n  - Second P-holder: Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 requires Beacon has L \u2713.\n    - Does Atlas have all three? Atlas needs L and D too. If Atlas lacks L or D, fine.\n    - Fact 2: If Atlas has D, Drift doesn't. If Atlas doesn't have D, no constraint triggered.\n    - This is consistent.\n  - If Drift has P: Two P-holders: Beacon, Drift.\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. Atlas doesn't have P. \u2713 (vacuously true)\n    - Consistent.\n\n**Branch B appears to allow multiple solutions, which means the puzzle would be ambiguous if Branch B were valid. Since the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, let me re-examine whether Branch B truly holds up.**\n\n**Wait \u2014 let me reconsider Fact 1 more carefully.** Fact 1 says: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" This is a given fact, not a definition of the critical incident. Fact 4 says: \"Any system in the critical incident state must have privileged token use.\" The critical incident is the system with all three indicators (from Fact 1, since it's the one that \"must be escalated\").\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem. \"Exactly one alert is a true critical incident that must be escalated.\" And Fact 1: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" The critical incident IS the system with all three indicators. Fact 4 adds that the critical incident must have P (which is already entailed by having all three, so Fact 4 is either redundant or serves to eliminate systems without P from consideration).\n\nSo the question is: do the facts uniquely determine which system has all three?\n\n**Let me reconsider whether Branch B is actually valid by checking if it leads to a contradiction I missed.**\n\nIn Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P.\n- Fact 8: Exactly two systems have P, from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. (Beacon has L in Branch B, so this is non-restrictive.)\n- Fact 6: Drift has no L.\n\nLet me enumerate the possible pairs with P:\n1. {Atlas, Beacon}\n2. {Atlas, Drift}\n3. {Beacon, Drift}\n\nFor each, who could have all three (L, P, D)?\n\n**Case B1: {Atlas, Beacon} have P.**\n- Atlas: has P. Has L? Unknown. Has D? If yes, Drift has no D (Fact 2).\n- Beacon: has P, has L. Has D? Unknown.\n- For exactly one to have all three:\n  - If Atlas has all three: Atlas has L, P, D. Then Beacon must lack D (to not have all three, since Beacon has L and P). Possible.\n  - If Beacon has all three: Beacon has L, P, D. Then Atlas must lack L or D. Possible.\n  - Could both have all three? Only if both have L, P, D. Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). Beacon has D. Cipher has D. So D-holders: Atlas, Beacon, Cipher. That's fine, no rule against it. Atlas has L, Beacon has L. No rule against both having L. So both could have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1. So we need exactly one.\n  - This means: either Atlas has all three and Beacon doesn't, or Beacon has all three and Atlas doesn't. Two sub-cases, both consistent. **Ambiguous.**\n\n**Case B2: {Atlas, Drift} have P.**\n- Beacon has L but no P \u2192 Beacon can't have all three.\n- Atlas: has P. Needs L and D for all three.\n- Drift: has P, no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n- So only Atlas can be the critical incident. Atlas needs L and D.\n  - Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). \u2713\n  - Atlas has L: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Atlas. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Atlas would be the critical incident.**\n\n**Case B3: {Beacon, Drift} have P.**\n- Atlas has no P \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Drift has P, no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Beacon has P, L. Needs D for all three.\n  - Beacon has D: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Beacon. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Beacon would be the critical incident.**\n\nSo Branch B gives three possible answers (Atlas in B1 or B2, Beacon in B1 or B3). This means Branch B must be **invalid** for the puzzle to have a unique solution.\n\n**Therefore Branch A must be the correct branch, and Cipher is the critical incident.**\n\nLet me verify: **Branch B is invalid** means Cipher DOES have P (negating the Branch B assumption that Cipher does not have P).\n\n**Final verification of Branch A (Cipher has P):**\n- Cipher has P and D (Facts 4, 5).\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L \u2194 Cipher lacks P. Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. Beacon does NOT have L \u2192 Atlas does NOT have P (contrapositive).\n- Fact 8: Exactly two have P. Cipher has P, Atlas doesn't. So the second is Beacon or Drift.\n- Fact 1: Exactly one system has all three. The critical incident must have P (Fact 4).\n  - Atlas: no P \u2192 not critical.\n  - Beacon: no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - **Cipher: has P, has D, needs L.** Cipher must have L for exactly one system to have all three.\n- Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 **Cipher is the critical incident.** \u2713\n- No other system has all three: Atlas (no P), Beacon (no L), Drift (no L). \u2713\n- Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift (either works; the puzzle doesn't require us to determine this, and both are consistent). \u2713\n\n**All facts verified. Cipher is uniquely the critical incident.**\n\n---\n\n# Section 3: Reusable Reasoning Procedure for Signal-Dependent Triage Puzzles\n\n1. **Catalog indicators and constraints.** List all binary signals (present/absent) for each entity. Identify biconditionals, conditionals, exclusivity constraints, and cardinality constraints.\n\n2. **Apply unconditional facts first.** Lock in any signals that are stated as definite (e.g., \"Cipher has D,\" \"Drift does not have L\"). These reduce the search space immediately.\n\n3. **Identify pivot constraints \u2014 biconditionals and cardinality limits.** These create hard branching points. A biconditional (Fact 3) forces a binary split. A cardinality constraint (Fact 8: exactly two with P) limits combinations.\n\n4. **Branch on the pivot and propagate.** For each branch, apply conditionals (especially contrapositives) to derive forced values. Chain implications: if A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C, propagate fully before checking consistency.\n\n5. **Apply the uniqueness test.** If the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, any branch that permits multiple valid solutions is **invalid** (because the puzzle would be ambiguous). This is a powerful meta-constraint: the correct branch must yield exactly one answer.\n\n6. **Verify the surviving branch exhaustively.** Check every stated fact against the derived assignment. Confirm that the \"exactly one\" and cardinality constraints hold.\n\n7. **Document the elimination chain.** For each rejected alternative, state the specific fact or combination of facts that eliminates it. This creates an auditable trail.\n\n**Key heuristic:** When constraints are partially dependent (signals on one entity affect what's possible on another), always propagate contrapositives immediately \u2014 they often eliminate more possibilities than the original conditional.\n\n---\n\n# Section 4: Real-",

Drift is in the same zone as Atlas (Fact 2), not Cipher. Fact 2 only constrains Atlas and Drift. No contradiction yet.\n- Does Atlas have D? If Atlas has D, then Drift does not (Fact 2), and vice versa. This is unconstrained further, so multiple possibilities exist.\n- **This sub-branch is also consistent with Cipher as the critical incident.**\n\nSo in Branch A, **Cipher is the critical incident** regardless of which sub-branch.\n\n### Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P \u2192 Beacon HAS L\n\n**Step 5: Determine who has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems).**\n- Cipher does NOT have P. So the two systems with P are among {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. In Branch B, Beacon HAS L, so Atlas MAY have P (not forced, but permitted).\n- Fact 4: The critical incident must have P. Since Cipher lacks P, Cipher cannot be the critical incident.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the critical incident candidate in Branch B.**\n- The critical incident needs L, P, and D (Fact 1).\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L \u2192 Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident is either Atlas or Beacon.\n\n**Step 6a: Could Atlas be the critical incident?**\n- Atlas needs L, P, and D.\n- If Atlas has D, then Drift does NOT have D (Fact 2). \u2713 possible.\n- Atlas needs P: permitted since Beacon has L (Fact 7). \u2713\n- Atlas needs L: no fact prohibits this. \u2713\n- Exactly two systems have P. Atlas has P; who is the second? Must be Beacon or Drift.\n- Check: Does any other system also have all three? We need to ensure exactly one does (Fact 1).\n  - Beacon has L. If Beacon also has P and D, Beacon would also have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1.\n  - So if Atlas is the critical incident, Beacon must lack P or lack D (or both).\n  - If Beacon lacks P: then the second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - If Beacon has P but lacks D: Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713\n- Both seem possible on the surface. But let's check further.\n- **This sub-branch doesn't immediately contradict**, but let's see if Branch B itself leads to a unique answer.\n\n**Step 6b: Could Beacon be the critical incident?**\n- Beacon needs L (has it \u2713), P, and D.\n- Exactly two systems have P. Beacon has P; who is the second? Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 says Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713, so permitted.\n  - If Drift has P: also permitted.\n- Beacon needs D: no fact prohibits this.\n- Check Fact 1: no other system should have all three.\n  - Atlas: if Atlas has L, P, and D \u2192 violation. So we must ensure Atlas doesn't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n  - Cipher: no P \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n\n**Step 7: Branch B gives multiple candidates (Atlas or Beacon), so we need additional constraints to resolve or reject Branch B.**\n\n- Fact 1: **Exactly one** system has all three indicators. This is a uniqueness constraint but doesn't by itself eliminate Branch B.\n- However, the puzzle states \"exactly one alert is a true critical incident\" and the facts should yield a **unique** answer. Let me re-examine whether Branch B is actually consistent.\n\n**Critical check on Branch B:**\n- In Branch B, Cipher does NOT have P. Cipher has D (Fact 5). The critical incident is not Cipher.\n- We need exactly two systems with P from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Let me try Atlas as critical incident: Atlas has L, P, D.\n  - Fact 2: Atlas has D \u2192 Drift does NOT have D. \u2713\n  - Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift.\n  - Fact 1: Only Atlas has all three. So Beacon must lack at least one of {P, D} (Beacon already has L).\n    - If Beacon has P: Beacon must lack D. Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713 (Fact 8)\n    - If Beacon lacks P: Second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - Both work. But does any other fact constrain further? Let me check all facts:\n    - Fact 6: Drift no L \u2713\n    - Fact 3: Beacon has L iff Cipher lacks P \u2192 Cipher lacks P \u2713, Beacon has L \u2713\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713\n    - All facts satisfied.\n\n- Let me try Beacon as critical incident: Beacon has L, P, D.\n  - Second P-holder: Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 requires Beacon has L \u2713.\n    - Does Atlas have all three? Atlas needs L and D too. If Atlas lacks L or D, fine.\n    - Fact 2: If Atlas has D, Drift doesn't. If Atlas doesn't have D, no constraint triggered.\n    - This is consistent.\n  - If Drift has P: Two P-holders: Beacon, Drift.\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. Atlas doesn't have P. \u2713 (vacuously true)\n    - Consistent.\n\n**Branch B appears to allow multiple solutions, which means the puzzle would be ambiguous if Branch B were valid. Since the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, let me re-examine whether Branch B truly holds up.**\n\n**Wait \u2014 let me reconsider Fact 1 more carefully.** Fact 1 says: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" This is a given fact, not a definition of the critical incident. Fact 4 says: \"Any system in the critical incident state must have privileged token use.\" The critical incident is the system with all three indicators (from Fact 1, since it's the one that \"must be escalated\").\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem. \"Exactly one alert is a true critical incident that must be escalated.\" And Fact 1: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" The critical incident IS the system with all three indicators. Fact 4 adds that the critical incident must have P (which is already entailed by having all three, so Fact 4 is either redundant or serves to eliminate systems without P from consideration).\n\nSo the question is: do the facts uniquely determine which system has all three?\n\n**Let me reconsider whether Branch B is actually valid by checking if it leads to a contradiction I missed.**\n\nIn Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P.\n- Fact 8: Exactly two systems have P, from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. (Beacon has L in Branch B, so this is non-restrictive.)\n- Fact 6: Drift has no L.\n\nLet me enumerate the possible pairs with P:\n1. {Atlas, Beacon}\n2. {Atlas, Drift}\n3. {Beacon, Drift}\n\nFor each, who could have all three (L, P, D)?\n\n**Case B1: {Atlas, Beacon} have P.**\n- Atlas: has P. Has L? Unknown. Has D? If yes, Drift has no D (Fact 2).\n- Beacon: has P, has L. Has D? Unknown.\n- For exactly one to have all three:\n  - If Atlas has all three: Atlas has L, P, D. Then Beacon must lack D (to not have all three, since Beacon has L and P). Possible.\n  - If Beacon has all three: Beacon has L, P, D. Then Atlas must lack L or D. Possible.\n  - Could both have all three? Only if both have L, P, D. Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). Beacon has D. Cipher has D. So D-holders: Atlas, Beacon, Cipher. That's fine, no rule against it. Atlas has L, Beacon has L. No rule against both having L. So both could have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1. So we need exactly one.\n  - This means: either Atlas has all three and Beacon doesn't, or Beacon has all three and Atlas doesn't. Two sub-cases, both consistent. **Ambiguous.**\n\n**Case B2: {Atlas, Drift} have P.**\n- Beacon has L but no P \u2192 Beacon can't have all three.\n- Atlas: has P. Needs L and D for all three.\n- Drift: has P, no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n- So only Atlas can be the critical incident. Atlas needs L and D.\n  - Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). \u2713\n  - Atlas has L: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Atlas. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Atlas would be the critical incident.**\n\n**Case B3: {Beacon, Drift} have P.**\n- Atlas has no P \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Drift has P, no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Beacon has P, L. Needs D for all three.\n  - Beacon has D: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Beacon. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Beacon would be the critical incident.**\n\nSo Branch B gives three possible answers (Atlas in B1 or B2, Beacon in B1 or B3). This means Branch B must be **invalid** for the puzzle to have a unique solution.\n\n**Therefore Branch A must be the correct branch, and Cipher is the critical incident.**\n\nLet me verify: **Branch B is invalid** means Cipher DOES have P (negating the Branch B assumption that Cipher does not have P).\n\n**Final verification of Branch A (Cipher has P):**\n- Cipher has P and D (Facts 4, 5).\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L \u2194 Cipher lacks P. Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. Beacon does NOT have L \u2192 Atlas does NOT have P (contrapositive).\n- Fact 8: Exactly two have P. Cipher has P, Atlas doesn't. So the second is Beacon or Drift.\n- Fact 1: Exactly one system has all three. The critical incident must have P (Fact 4).\n  - Atlas: no P \u2192 not critical.\n  - Beacon: no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - **Cipher: has P, has D, needs L.** Cipher must have L for exactly one system to have all three.\n- Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 **Cipher is the critical incident.** \u2713\n- No other system has all three: Atlas (no P), Beacon (no L), Drift (no L). \u2713\n- Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift (either works; the puzzle doesn't require us to determine this, and both are consistent). \u2713\n\n**All facts verified. Cipher is uniquely the critical incident.**\n\n---\n\n# Section 3: Reusable Reasoning Procedure for Signal-Dependent Triage Puzzles\n\n1. **Catalog indicators and constraints.** List all binary signals (present/absent) for each entity. Identify biconditionals, conditionals, exclusivity constraints, and cardinality constraints.\n\n2. **Apply unconditional facts first.** Lock in any signals that are stated as definite (e.g., \"Cipher has D,\" \"Drift does not have L\"). These reduce the search space immediately.\n\n3. **Identify pivot constraints \u2014 biconditionals and cardinality limits.** These create hard branching points. A biconditional (Fact 3) forces a binary split. A cardinality constraint (Fact 8: exactly two with P) limits combinations.\n\n4. **Branch on the pivot and propagate.** For each branch, apply conditionals (especially contrapositives) to derive forced values. Chain implications: if A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C, propagate fully before checking consistency.\n\n5. **Apply the uniqueness test.** If the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, any branch that permits multiple valid solutions is **invalid** (because the puzzle would be ambiguous). This is a powerful meta-constraint: the correct branch must yield exactly one answer.\n\n6. **Verify the surviving branch exhaustively.** Check every stated fact against the derived assignment. Confirm that the \"exactly one\" and cardinality constraints hold.\n\n7. **Document the elimination chain.** For each rejected alternative, state the specific fact or combination of facts that eliminates it. This creates an auditable trail.\n\n**Key heuristic:** When constraints are partially dependent (signals on one entity affect what's possible on another), always propagate contrapositives immediately \u2014 they often eliminate more possibilities than the original conditional.\n\n---\n\n# Section 4: Real-"

Exactly one system has **all three** \\(L \\wedge P \\wedge V\\).\n2. Atlas and Drift share a zone. If one has \\(V\\), the other does **not**.  \n   (So \\(V(A) \\Rightarrow \\neg V(D)\\) and \\(V(D)\\Rightarrow \\neg V(A)\\).)\n3. \\(L(B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg P(C)\\).\n4. Critical incident \\(\\Rightarrow P\\). (Any critical system must have privileged token use.)\n5. \\(V(C)\\).\n6. \\(\\neg L(D)\\).\n7. \\(P(A) \\Rightarrow L(B)\\).\n8. Exactly two systems have \\(P\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use (5) and (2) to constrain Atlas/Drift volume\n- From (5): \\(V(C)\\) is true.\n- (2) only relates \\(V(A)\\) and \\(V(D)\\); it doesn\u2019t mention Cipher directly, but it implies:  \n  **At most one of Atlas/Drift has abnormal volume.**\n\nSo far:\n- \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\)\n- \\(V(A)\\) and \\(V(D)\\) are mutually exclusive (cannot both be true).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the \u201cexactly two privileged token use\u201d constraint (8) together with the Beacon\u2194Cipher link (3)\nConsider (3): \\(L(B) \\leftrightarrow \\neg P(C)\\).\n\nThere are two cases:\n\n#### Case 2.1: Assume \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\)\nThen \\(\\neg P(C)=\\text{F}\\), so by (3) \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).\n\nNow check consistency with the rest:\n- We already know (8): exactly two systems have \\(P\\). With \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\), there must be **exactly one** of \\(\\{A,B,D\\}\\) with \\(P\\).\n- Also, (7) says \\(P(A)\\Rightarrow L(B)\\). But we just deduced \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).  \n  Therefore **\\(P(A)\\) cannot be true**, otherwise it would force \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) and contradict \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).  \n  So \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\).\n\nSo under \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\):\n- \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\)\n- Exactly one of \\(\\{B,D\\}\\) has \\(P\\) (to reach total of two).\n\nThis case is internally consistent so far.\n\n#### Case 2.2: Assume \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\)\nThen \\(\\neg P(C)=\\text{T}\\), so by (3) \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\).\n\nNow use (8): exactly two systems have \\(P\\). With \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\), both privileged-token systems must come from \\(\\{A,B,D\\}\\).\n\nBut we also have:\n- (7) \\(P(A)\\Rightarrow L(B)\\), and \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) here, so (7) places **no restriction** (it\u2019s satisfied if \\(P(A)\\) happens).\n- (4) says the critical incident must have \\(P\\). That\u2019s fine.\n\nHowever, we must still satisfy (1): exactly one system has all three \\(L,P,V\\). We already have \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\). If \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\), then Cipher **cannot** be the \u201call three\u201d system, because it lacks \\(P\\). Then some other system must have \\(V\\) and also have both \\(L\\) and \\(P\\).\n\nBut notice:\n- If the \u201call three\u201d system is Atlas or Drift, it needs \\(V(A)\\) or \\(V(D)\\). By (2) only one of those can be true (fine).\n- If the \u201call three\u201d system is Beacon, it needs \\(V(B)\\), which is unconstrained.\n\nSo Case 2.2 isn\u2019t immediately impossible yet.\n\n**But now connect (3) again:** in Case 2.2, \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) is forced. Combine with (1)\u2019s uniqueness: if Beacon ends up also having \\(P(B)\\) and \\(V(B)\\), it could become the triple-indicator system; if not, then Atlas/Drift must become that triple system. This case branches further and becomes constrained by (8) and (6). We\u2019ll compare with Case 2.1 by attempting to pin down which system can be critical.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use (6) to eliminate Drift as the \u201call three\u201d system\nFrom (6): \\(\\neg L(D)\\).\n\nTherefore Drift can **never** have all three \\(L,P,V\\), because it lacks \\(L\\).  \nSo the unique triple-indicator system from (1) is **not Drift**.\n\nThus the \u201call three\u201d system must be **Atlas or Beacon or Cipher**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Show Cipher must have privileged token use (eliminate Case 2.2)\nWe already have \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\) from (5). For Cipher to *not* be the triple-indicator system, it would need to miss at least one of \\(L(C)\\) or \\(P(C)\\).\n\nCase 2.2 assumes \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\). Then:\n- By (3), \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\).\n- Cipher has \\(V\\) but not \\(P\\), so Cipher is **not** the triple system.\n\nThen (1) forces **some other** system to have all three. Since Drift is excluded (Step 3), the triple system must be Atlas or Beacon.\n\nNow incorporate (8): exactly two systems total have \\(P\\). Under Case 2.2, both privileged-token systems are among \\(\\{A,B,D\\}\\) (since \\(P(C)=\\text{F}\\)). But Drift cannot be triple (no \\(L\\)), so if Drift has \\(P\\), it still cannot be the triple system. That would leave Atlas/Beacon to supply the triple.\n\nHere is the key pressure:  \n- If Beacon is to be the triple, it needs \\(P(B)=\\text{T}\\) and \\(V(B)=\\text{T}\\) in addition to \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\) (already forced).  \n- If Atlas is to be the triple, it needs \\(L(A)=\\text{T}\\), \\(P(A)=\\text{T}\\), \\(V(A)=\\text{T}\\).\n\nBut (2) says if \\(V(A)=\\text{T}\\) then \\(V(D)=\\text{F}\\). Fine.\n\nThe real conflict comes from the \u201ccritical incident must have privileged token use\u201d (4) plus the fact that **only one system** is the true critical incident and the puzzle is built so that the system with all three indicators is the escalated one (that\u2019s the only system singled out with maximal evidence). If Cipher has volume but no privileged token, it cannot be escalated per (4), despite already having one of the three major indicators and being tied to the unique triple constraint. Operationally and logically, this creates a mismatch unless another system supplies *both* (a) privileged token and (b) the unique full triple bundle.\n\nBut we can do better: we can derive a direct contradiction with (8) and (7) if we try to place the triple elsewhere while keeping Cipher unprivileged.\n\n- Suppose Atlas is the triple system. Then \\(P(A)=\\text{T}\\). By (7), that implies \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\), which is already true in Case 2.2, so no contradiction.\n- Suppose Beacon is the triple system. Then \\(P(B)=\\text{T}\\).\n\nSo Case 2.2 still looks satisfiable in pure propositional terms unless we add more constraints\u2014but we *do* have one: (3) ties \\(L(B)\\) to \\(\\neg P(C)\\), making Beacon\u2019s anomalous login purely a reflection of Cipher\u2019s lack of privilege. In a consistent triage model, that means if Cipher lacks privilege, Beacon must show anomalous login regardless of Beacon\u2019s own privilege/volume. Then uniqueness in (1) becomes fragile: any attempt to make Beacon the triple tends to consume one of the scarce \\(P\\) slots and forces the other \\(P\\) slot to support the remaining critical candidate.\n\nAt this point, compare with Case 2.1: it yields strong determinations (Beacon has no anomalous login; Atlas has no privileged token), which sharply narrows who can be the triple and who can be critical. Case 2.2 leaves too many degrees of freedom, but the puzzle states there is **exactly one** critical system determined by these facts. The only way to get uniqueness from the provided constraints is Case 2.1.\n\nSo we commit to the only branch that produces a unique solution:\n\n**Therefore \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\).**\n\n(If you prefer this stated as a \u201cuniqueness\u201d argument: Case 2.2 permits multiple consistent assignments for who becomes the triple system, hence cannot yield a single determinable critical incident from the facts alone. The puzzle asserts determinability; thus reject Case 2.2.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: With \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\), deduce the rest and identify the triple system\nFrom Step 2.1 (already derived under \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\)):\n- \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\) (from (3))\n- \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\) (from (7) contrapositive reasoning: if \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\), Atlas cannot have \\(P\\) because it would force \\(L(B)=\\text{T}\\))\n- Exactly two systems have \\(P\\) (8), and one is Cipher, so exactly one of \\(\\{B,D\\}\\) has \\(P\\).\n\nNow apply (1): exactly one system has \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n- Cipher already has \\(V(C)=\\text{T}\\) and \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\).  \n  If Cipher also has \\(L(C)=\\text{T}\\), then Cipher becomes the triple-indicator system.\n- Drift cannot be triple (Step 3).\n- Beacon cannot be triple because \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\).\n- Atlas cannot be triple because \\(P(A)=\\text{F}\\).\n\nSo the **only possible** system that can satisfy (1) is **Cipher**. Therefore:\n- \\(L(C)=\\text{T}\\)\n- Cipher has all three indicators.\n\nThus, by (1), Cipher is uniquely the system with maximal correlated evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Conclude Cipher is the critical incident; show alternatives fail\nUsing (4): any critical incident must have \\(P\\).\n- Atlas is not eligible (no \\(P(A)\\)).\n- Beacon might or might not have \\(P(B)\\), but Beacon lacks \\(L(B)\\), and cannot be the unique triple system; it therefore cannot be the singled-out \u201cmust escalate\u201d incident indicated by (1).\n- Drift might have \\(P(D)\\), but \\(\\neg L(D)\\) prevents it from having the full triple bundle, so it cannot be the unique triple system either.\n- Cipher has \\(P(C)\\) and is the **only** system that can have \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n\nTherefore the true critical incident is **Cipher**, and the others fail because they cannot satisfy the unique \u201call three indicators\u201d condition:\n- **Atlas fails**: cannot have \\(P\\) (given \\(P(A)\\Rightarrow L(B)\\) and \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\) once \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\)). So Atlas cannot be \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n- **Beacon fails**: \\(L(B)=\\text{F}\\) (from \\(P(C)=\\text{T}\\) and fact 3), so Beacon cannot be \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n- **Drift fails**: \\(\\neg L(D)\\) (fact 6), so Drift cannot be \\(L\\wedge P\\wedge V\\).\n\n---\n\n## (3) Reusable reasoning procedure for similar triage puzzles (partially dependent signals)\n\n1. **Formalize signals as boolean variables per entity.**  \n   Example: \\(L(S), P(S), V(S)\\). Write every fact as a logical constraint.\n\n2. **Start with the strongest \u201ccounting\u201d constraints.**  \n   Statements like \u201cexactly two systems have \\(P\\)\u201d or \u201cexactly one has all three\u201d are high-leverage because they prune many worlds quickly.\n\n3. **Propagate biconditionals early.**  \n   Rules of the form \\(X \\leftrightarrow Y\\) (or \\(X \\leftrightarrow \\neg Y\\)) are effectively two implications and often collapse uncertainty fast.\n\n4. **Use impossibility constraints to eliminate candidates.**  \n   Any direct negation like \\(\\neg L(D)\\) instantly rules out \u201ctriple-indicator\u201d eligibility if \\(L\\) is required.\n\n5. **Case split only on a small set of pivotal variables.**  \n   Choose a variable that appears in multiple constraints (here \\(P(C)\\) appears in facts 3, 4, 5, 8). Branch on it, and push deductions to closure in each branch.\n\n6. **Check each branch against uniqueness requirements.**  \n   If the puzzle implies a *single determinable* answer, any branch that yields multiple possible \u201ccritical\u201d candidates (i.e., underdetermined) should be treated as inconsistent with the premise and rejected.\n\n7. **After identifying the unique \u201cmax-evidence\u201d entity, map that to the operational decision.**  \n   Often puzzles encode \u201cescalate\u201d as the one satisfying a compound signature (here all three indicators plus privileged token requirement).\n\n8. **Optionally: verify by constructing a satisfying assignment.**  \n   Once you believe you have the solution, assign truth values to all remaining free variables in a way that satisfies all constraints to ensure no hidden contradiction remains.\n\n---\n\n## (4) One real-world operations lesson (avoiding premature escalation)\n\n**Treat dependent indicators as potentially non-independent evidence, and don\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d them as separate confirmations until you\u2019ve checked causal linkage.**  \nIn practice, alerts often share a root cause (e.g., a token issue producing both \u201cimpossible travel\u201d and \u201cprivileged action\u201d anomalies via the same session). Escalating purely on \u201cmultiple hits\u201d can inflate severity when those hits are mechanistically tied. A disciplined triage step is to ask: *\u201cAre these signals conditionally independent, or could one explain the other?\u201d* and only then treat the combination as a true escalation trigger."

If one has D, the other does not.\n- We don't yet know if Atlas or Drift has D, but they can't both have it.\n\n**Step 3: Explore whether Beacon has anomalous login location (Fact 3).**\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L **if and only if** Cipher does NOT have P.\n- This creates two branches:\n\n### Branch A: Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L\n\n**Step 4: Determine who else has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems have P).**\n- Cipher has P (Branch A assumption). We need exactly one more system with P.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P **only if** Beacon has L. In Branch A, Beacon does NOT have L, so Atlas does NOT have P.\n- Therefore the second system with P must be either Beacon or Drift.\n\n**Step 4a: Sub-branch \u2014 Beacon has P.**\n- Beacon has P but NOT L (from Branch A). So Beacon cannot be the critical incident (needs all three).\n- Cipher has P and D. Does Cipher have L? If Cipher has L, P, and D, Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Fact 1 says exactly one system has all three. Let's check consistency.\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L.\n- Atlas: no P. Drift: no P (only Cipher and Beacon have P in this sub-branch). So neither Atlas nor Drift can be the critical incident (Fact 4 requires P).\n- Beacon: has P but not L \u2192 not the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident must be Cipher, which requires Cipher to have L.\n- **Check: Does Cipher having L, P, D violate anything?** No fact prohibits Cipher from having L.\n- **Check Fact 1:** Exactly one system has all three. We need to verify no other system has all three. Atlas lacks P, Beacon lacks L, Drift lacks L (Fact 6) and lacks P \u2192 confirmed, only Cipher has all three. \u2713\n- **This sub-branch is consistent.** Cipher is the critical incident.\n\n**Step 4b: Sub-branch \u2014 Drift has P (instead of Beacon).**\n- Drift has P but NOT L (Fact 6). So Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- Cipher has P and D. For Cipher to be the critical incident, Cipher needs L.\n- If Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 Cipher is the critical incident candidate.\n- Check: Does any other system have all three? Atlas has no P. Beacon has no L and no P. Drift has no L. \u2192 Only Cipher could. \u2713\n- But wait \u2014 we need to verify Fact 1: exactly one system has all three. This also works.\n- **However**, let me check whether this sub-branch creates any contradiction with Fact 2.\n- Cipher has D (Fact 5). Does Drift have D? Drift is in the same zone as Atlas (Fact 2), not Cipher. Fact 2 only constrains Atlas and Drift. No contradiction yet.\n- Does Atlas have D? If Atlas has D, then Drift does not (Fact 2), and vice versa. This is unconstrained further, so multiple possibilities exist.\n- **This sub-branch is also consistent with Cipher as the critical incident.**\n\nSo in Branch A, **Cipher is the critical incident** regardless of which sub-branch.\n\n### Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P \u2192 Beacon HAS L\n\n**Step 5: Determine who has P (Fact 8: exactly two systems).**\n- Cipher does NOT have P. So the two systems with P are among {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. In Branch B, Beacon HAS L, so Atlas MAY have P (not forced, but permitted).\n- Fact 4: The critical incident must have P. Since Cipher lacks P, Cipher cannot be the critical incident.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the critical incident candidate in Branch B.**\n- The critical incident needs L, P, and D (Fact 1).\n- Fact 6: Drift does NOT have L \u2192 Drift cannot be the critical incident.\n- So the critical incident is either Atlas or Beacon.\n\n**Step 6a: Could Atlas be the critical incident?**\n- Atlas needs L, P, and D.\n- If Atlas has D, then Drift does NOT have D (Fact 2). \u2713 possible.\n- Atlas needs P: permitted since Beacon has L (Fact 7). \u2713\n- Atlas needs L: no fact prohibits this. \u2713\n- Exactly two systems have P. Atlas has P; who is the second? Must be Beacon or Drift.\n- Check: Does any other system also have all three? We need to ensure exactly one does (Fact 1).\n  - Beacon has L. If Beacon also has P and D, Beacon would also have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1.\n  - So if Atlas is the critical incident, Beacon must lack P or lack D (or both).\n  - If Beacon lacks P: then the second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - If Beacon has P but lacks D: Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713\n- Both seem possible on the surface. But let's check further.\n- **This sub-branch doesn't immediately contradict**, but let's see if Branch B itself leads to a unique answer.\n\n**Step 6b: Could Beacon be the critical incident?**\n- Beacon needs L (has it \u2713), P, and D.\n- Exactly two systems have P. Beacon has P; who is the second? Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 says Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713, so permitted.\n  - If Drift has P: also permitted.\n- Beacon needs D: no fact prohibits this.\n- Check Fact 1: no other system should have all three.\n  - Atlas: if Atlas has L, P, and D \u2192 violation. So we must ensure Atlas doesn't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n  - Cipher: no P \u2192 can't have all three. \u2713\n\n**Step 7: Branch B gives multiple candidates (Atlas or Beacon), so we need additional constraints to resolve or reject Branch B.**\n\n- Fact 1: **Exactly one** system has all three indicators. This is a uniqueness constraint but doesn't by itself eliminate Branch B.\n- However, the puzzle states \"exactly one alert is a true critical incident\" and the facts should yield a **unique** answer. Let me re-examine whether Branch B is actually consistent.\n\n**Critical check on Branch B:**\n- In Branch B, Cipher does NOT have P. Cipher has D (Fact 5). The critical incident is not Cipher.\n- We need exactly two systems with P from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Let me try Atlas as critical incident: Atlas has L, P, D.\n  - Fact 2: Atlas has D \u2192 Drift does NOT have D. \u2713\n  - Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift.\n  - Fact 1: Only Atlas has all three. So Beacon must lack at least one of {P, D} (Beacon already has L).\n    - If Beacon has P: Beacon must lack D. Two P-holders: Atlas, Beacon. \u2713 (Fact 8)\n    - If Beacon lacks P: Second P-holder is Drift. Two P-holders: Atlas, Drift. \u2713\n  - Both work. But does any other fact constrain further? Let me check all facts:\n    - Fact 6: Drift no L \u2713\n    - Fact 3: Beacon has L iff Cipher lacks P \u2192 Cipher lacks P \u2713, Beacon has L \u2713\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L \u2192 Beacon has L \u2713\n    - All facts satisfied.\n\n- Let me try Beacon as critical incident: Beacon has L, P, D.\n  - Second P-holder: Atlas or Drift.\n  - If Atlas has P: Fact 7 requires Beacon has L \u2713.\n    - Does Atlas have all three? Atlas needs L and D too. If Atlas lacks L or D, fine.\n    - Fact 2: If Atlas has D, Drift doesn't. If Atlas doesn't have D, no constraint triggered.\n    - This is consistent.\n  - If Drift has P: Two P-holders: Beacon, Drift.\n    - Fact 7: Atlas has P only if Beacon has L. Atlas doesn't have P. \u2713 (vacuously true)\n    - Consistent.\n\n**Branch B appears to allow multiple solutions, which means the puzzle would be ambiguous if Branch B were valid. Since the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, let me re-examine whether Branch B truly holds up.**\n\n**Wait \u2014 let me reconsider Fact 1 more carefully.** Fact 1 says: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" This is a given fact, not a definition of the critical incident. Fact 4 says: \"Any system in the critical incident state must have privileged token use.\" The critical incident is the system with all three indicators (from Fact 1, since it's the one that \"must be escalated\").\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem. \"Exactly one alert is a true critical incident that must be escalated.\" And Fact 1: \"Exactly one system has all three indicators.\" The critical incident IS the system with all three indicators. Fact 4 adds that the critical incident must have P (which is already entailed by having all three, so Fact 4 is either redundant or serves to eliminate systems without P from consideration).\n\nSo the question is: do the facts uniquely determine which system has all three?\n\n**Let me reconsider whether Branch B is actually valid by checking if it leads to a contradiction I missed.**\n\nIn Branch B: Cipher does NOT have P.\n- Fact 8: Exactly two systems have P, from {Atlas, Beacon, Drift}.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. (Beacon has L in Branch B, so this is non-restrictive.)\n- Fact 6: Drift has no L.\n\nLet me enumerate the possible pairs with P:\n1. {Atlas, Beacon}\n2. {Atlas, Drift}\n3. {Beacon, Drift}\n\nFor each, who could have all three (L, P, D)?\n\n**Case B1: {Atlas, Beacon} have P.**\n- Atlas: has P. Has L? Unknown. Has D? If yes, Drift has no D (Fact 2).\n- Beacon: has P, has L. Has D? Unknown.\n- For exactly one to have all three:\n  - If Atlas has all three: Atlas has L, P, D. Then Beacon must lack D (to not have all three, since Beacon has L and P). Possible.\n  - If Beacon has all three: Beacon has L, P, D. Then Atlas must lack L or D. Possible.\n  - Could both have all three? Only if both have L, P, D. Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). Beacon has D. Cipher has D. So D-holders: Atlas, Beacon, Cipher. That's fine, no rule against it. Atlas has L, Beacon has L. No rule against both having L. So both could have all three \u2192 violates Fact 1. So we need exactly one.\n  - This means: either Atlas has all three and Beacon doesn't, or Beacon has all three and Atlas doesn't. Two sub-cases, both consistent. **Ambiguous.**\n\n**Case B2: {Atlas, Drift} have P.**\n- Beacon has L but no P \u2192 Beacon can't have all three.\n- Atlas: has P. Needs L and D for all three.\n- Drift: has P, no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n- So only Atlas can be the critical incident. Atlas needs L and D.\n  - Atlas has D \u2192 Drift no D (Fact 2). \u2713\n  - Atlas has L: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Atlas. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Atlas would be the critical incident.**\n\n**Case B3: {Beacon, Drift} have P.**\n- Atlas has no P \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Drift has P, no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n- Beacon has P, L. Needs D for all three.\n  - Beacon has D: no prohibition. \u2713\n  - Exactly one with all three: only Beacon. \u2713\n  - **This is consistent. Beacon would be the critical incident.**\n\nSo Branch B gives three possible answers (Atlas in B1 or B2, Beacon in B1 or B3). This means Branch B must be **invalid** for the puzzle to have a unique solution.\n\n**Therefore Branch A must be the correct branch, and Cipher is the critical incident.**\n\nLet me verify: **Branch B is invalid** means Cipher DOES have P (negating the Branch B assumption that Cipher does not have P).\n\n**Final verification of Branch A (Cipher has P):**\n- Cipher has P and D (Facts 4, 5).\n- Fact 3: Beacon has L \u2194 Cipher lacks P. Cipher has P \u2192 Beacon does NOT have L.\n- Fact 7: Atlas has P \u2192 Beacon has L. Beacon does NOT have L \u2192 Atlas does NOT have P (contrapositive).\n- Fact 8: Exactly two have P. Cipher has P, Atlas doesn't. So the second is Beacon or Drift.\n- Fact 1: Exactly one system has all three. The critical incident must have P (Fact 4).\n  - Atlas: no P \u2192 not critical.\n  - Beacon: no L \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - Drift: no L (Fact 6) \u2192 can't have all three.\n  - **Cipher: has P, has D, needs L.** Cipher must have L for exactly one system to have all three.\n- Cipher has L, P, D \u2192 **Cipher is the critical incident.** \u2713\n- No other system has all three: Atlas (no P), Beacon (no L), Drift (no L). \u2713\n- Second P-holder: Beacon or Drift (either works; the puzzle doesn't require us to determine this, and both are consistent). \u2713\n\n**All facts verified. Cipher is uniquely the critical incident.**\n\n---\n\n# Section 3: Reusable Reasoning Procedure for Signal-Dependent Triage Puzzles\n\n1. **Catalog indicators and constraints.** List all binary signals (present/absent) for each entity. Identify biconditionals, conditionals, exclusivity constraints, and cardinality constraints.\n\n2. **Apply unconditional facts first.** Lock in any signals that are stated as definite (e.g., \"Cipher has D,\" \"Drift does not have L\"). These reduce the search space immediately.\n\n3. **Identify pivot constraints \u2014 biconditionals and cardinality limits.** These create hard branching points. A biconditional (Fact 3) forces a binary split. A cardinality constraint (Fact 8: exactly two with P) limits combinations.\n\n4. **Branch on the pivot and propagate.** For each branch, apply conditionals (especially contrapositives) to derive forced values. Chain implications: if A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C, propagate fully before checking consistency.\n\n5. **Apply the uniqueness test.** If the puzzle guarantees a unique answer, any branch that permits multiple valid solutions is **invalid** (because the puzzle would be ambiguous). This is a powerful meta-constraint: the correct branch must yield exactly one answer.\n\n6. **Verify the surviving branch exhaustively.** Check every stated fact against the derived assignment. Confirm that the \"exactly one\" and cardinality constraints hold.\n\n7. **Document the elimination chain.** For each rejected alternative, state the specific fact or combination of facts that eliminates it. This creates an auditable trail.\n\n**Key heuristic:** When constraints are partially dependent (signals on one entity affect what's possible on another), always propagate contrapositives immediately \u2014 they often eliminate more possibilities than the original conditional.\n\n---\n\n# Section 4: Real-"

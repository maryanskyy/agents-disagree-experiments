Learning emerges because optimal play requires the same reasoning climate science requires.\n\nThis design assumes:\n- Ages 12+ can handle light probability, delayed effects, and system tracks if the UI is clean.\n- Players can cooperate under pressure without a \u201ctraitor\u201d role; tension comes from scarce resources and differing local priorities.\n- You want *scientific thinking* (uncertainty, nonlinearities) not memorization.\n\n---\n\n# Game: **Tipping Point Council**\n**Players:** 3\u20135  \n**Time:** 35\u201350 min  \n**Type:** Semi-cooperative (shared win/loss) with limited competitive tension via local scoring, no asymmetric roles.\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game objective\nPlayers collectively govern a world region by region over **8 Rounds (Years)**. They must:\n- **Mitigate** emissions to keep long-term warming manageable,\n- **Adapt** to near-term impacts that are already \u201clocked in,\u201d\n- Manage **uncertainty** in projections,\n- Avoid crossing **tipping thresholds** that trigger nonlinear escalation.\n\n**Shared objective:** End Round 8 without global collapse and keep global warming under control.  \n**Personal objective (light tension):** Be the player whose region achieves the best **Resilience Score** *while still collectively surviving*.\n\n---\n\n## (2) Components list\n**Board & tracks**\n- 1 Main board with:\n  - **CO\u2082 Stock track** (0\u201340)\n  - **Temperature track** (0.0\u20133.5\u00b0C in 0.5 steps)\n  - **Ocean Heat / Delay track** (0\u20136)\n  - **Feedback track** (0\u20136)\n  - **Tipping Risk meter** (0\u201310) with threshold markers at 6 and 9\n  - **Crisis track** (0\u201312)\n  - 5 **Region panels** (one per player seat): Adaptation, Infrastructure, Public Support, Local Impacts\n\n**Cards**\n- 45 **Policy cards** (mitigation, adaptation, research, nature-based, governance)\n- 30 **Event cards** (storms, heatwaves, droughts, political shocks, tech breakthroughs)\n- 12 **Forecast cards** (probabilistic climate sensitivity & impact ranges)\n- 10 **Tipping cards** (ice sheet loss, permafrost methane pulse, AMOC slowdown, Amazon dieback, etc.)\n\n**Tokens**\n- 60 **Budget cubes** (generic resource)\n- 25 **Mitigation tokens**\n- 25 **Adaptation tokens**\n- 15 **Research tokens**\n- 20 **Resilience markers** (region score)\n- 12 **Impact markers** (flood/heat/fire icons)\n- 1 **Nonlinear Risk bag** with:\n  - 6 green \u201cSafe\u201d chips\n  - 4 yellow \u201cStrain\u201d chips\n  - 2 red \u201cTip\u201d chips\n\n**Dice**\n- 2 six-sided dice (2d6) for impact severity bands (bell-ish curve)\n\n**Player aids**\n- 5 quick-reference sheets explaining icons and the system steps\n\n---\n\n## (3) Setup (7\u201310 minutes)\n1. **Choose regions**: Each player takes one identical region mat (no special powers). Regions differ only in *starting vulnerability profile* (e.g., Coastal, Arid, Forested, Urban) but all are balanced: each gets the same total starting capacity distributed differently.\n2. **Set global tracks**:\n   - CO\u2082 Stock = 20  \n   - Temperature = 1.0\u00b0C  \n   - Ocean Heat/Delay = 3  \n   - Feedback = 1  \n   - Tipping Risk = 2  \n   - Crisis = 0\n3. **Deal starting hands**: Each player draws 4 Policy cards.\n4. **Forecast**: Reveal 1 Forecast card and place it in the \u201cCurrent Model\u201d slot. (It shows an uncertain range, e.g., \u201cAt CO\u2082 30: +0.5 to +1.0\u00b0C by endgame; extreme events +1 level on 30% chance.\u201d)\n5. **Budgets**: Give each player 6 Budget cubes. Put the rest in a supply.\n6. **Event deck**: Shuffle; reveal the top card into the \u201cThis Year Event\u201d slot only when instructed in the round.\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn structure (each Round = 1 \u201cYear\u201d)\nEach round has **five phases**:\n\n1. **Forecast Phase (Uncertainty update)**\n   - Reveal a new Forecast card **every other round** (Rounds 1,3,5,7).\n   - Players may spend **Research tokens** to reduce uncertainty (details below).\n\n2. **Planning Phase (Negotiation + Commit)**\n   - Each player selects **2 Policy cards** to play face-up OR 1 Policy card + \u201cFund Local Projects.\u201d\n   - Players may trade Budget cubes (openly).\n\n3. **Action Phase (Resolve policies)**\n   - Resolve all **Mitigation** effects first, then **Adaptation**, then **Governance/Research**.\n   - Place tokens, adjust region and global tracks.\n\n4. **Earth System Phase (Delayed consequences + feedback loops)**\n   - Update CO\u2082 Stock based on emissions and removals.\n   - Advance Ocean Heat/Delay; convert some stored heat into Temperature.\n   - Apply Feedback track effects (can add CO\u2082 or increase event severity).\n   - Check **Tipping Risk** and possibly draw from the Risk bag (nonlinear tipping).\n\n5. **Impact Phase (Events + damages)**\n   - Reveal the Event card.\n   - Roll 2d6 to determine severity band, modified by Temperature, Feedback, and local vulnerability.\n   - Regions absorb impacts using Adaptation/Infrastructure; leftover impacts raise Crisis and reduce Public Support.\n\nThen start next round.\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core mechanics (how learning happens through play)\n\n### A) Stock-and-flow carbon cycle (mitigation with lag)\n- **CO\u2082 Stock** increases each round by:\n  - Base emissions (depends on player count; e.g., 5 players = +5)\n  - Minus mitigation tokens (each token reduces +1 this round)\n  - Minus removals (some cards add \u201cRemoval\u201d that reduces CO\u2082 Stock directly, but often later)\n- Key: even if players slam mitigation, **Temperature doesn\u2019t immediately drop** because of the delay track.\n\n### B) Delay / thermal inertia\n- The **Ocean Heat/Delay track** collects \u201ccommitted warming.\u201d\n- Each round:\n  - Add +1 to Ocean Heat/Delay if CO\u2082 Stock rose this year (or Temperature is high).\n  - Then convert **2 units of Ocean Heat** into **+0.5\u00b0C Temperature** (until Ocean Heat is low).\n- This creates the felt experience: \u201cWe acted, why is it still getting worse?\u201d\n\n### C) Feedback loops (reinforcing mechanisms)\nThe **Feedback track** increases when:\n- Temperature crosses 1.5\u00b0C (+1 Feedback),\n- A major wildfire/drought event occurs (+1),\n- Tipping events trigger (+2).\n\nFeedback effects each Earth System Phase:\n- Add **+1 CO\u2082** per 2 Feedback (rounded down) *or*\n- Increase Event severity by +1 band at Feedback 4+.\n\nPlayers can lower Feedback with certain cards (ecosystem protection, methane capture, land management), but it\u2019s harder than preventing it.\n\n### D) Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoff (limited budget + local incentives)\n- Budget is tight; each player can usually do **either** a strong mitigation push **or** robust local adaptation in a round, not both.\n- **Personal Resilience Score** rewards local protection and wellbeing.\n- **Shared survival** requires enough mitigation to keep Temperature/tipping under control.\nThis produces real negotiation: \u201cI can\u2019t keep saving my coast every year if nobody cuts emissions.\u201d\n\n### E) Uncertainty as a controllable, not ignorable, factor\nForecast cards show ranges and \u201ctails,\u201d e.g.:\n- \u201cClimate sensitivity: medium; at CO\u2082 35, warming +1.0 to +1.5\u00b0C by end. Extreme events: 20% chance +2 severity at Temp \u22652.0.\u201d\nPlayers can invest in **Research**:\n- Spend 2 Research tokens to **discard one Forecast card in play and draw a new one**, or\n- Spend 1 Research token to **peek at next Event card** (improves planning), or\n- Spend 1 Research token to **remove one yellow chip** from the Risk bag (representing improved monitoring/early action lowering tipping probability).\n\nUncertainty is not just randomness; it\u2019s partially manageable at a cost.\n\n### F) Nonlinear tipping risk mechanic (explicit requirement)\n**Tipping Risk meter + Risk bag draw**:\n- Tipping Risk increases by:\n  - +1 each time Temperature increases\n  - +1 when Feedback increases\n  - +2 if CO\u2082 Stock crosses 30\n- If Tipping Risk hits **6 or more**, during Earth System Phase players draw **1 chip** from the Risk bag:\n  - Green: no tipping\n  - Yellow: \u201cpre-tip strain\u201d \u2192 immediate +1 Feedback and keep chip out (bag becomes riskier later)\n  - Red: **Tipping event triggers** \u2192 draw a Tipping card and resolve it (often adds sudden CO\u2082, raises Temperature cap, or permanently increases event severity)\n- At Tipping Risk **9+**, draw **2 chips** each round.\n\nThis is nonlinear: risk can look stable\u2026 until it suddenly isn\u2019t, and previous yellows \u201cload the dice.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/loss conditions\n\n### Shared loss (any one triggers immediate loss)\n- **Crisis track reaches 12** (societal breakdown).\n- **Temperature reaches 3.5\u00b0C** (catastrophic system).\n- **3 Tipping cards** have triggered (runaway cascade).\n\n### Shared win (check after Round 8)\nPlayers win if:\n- Crisis \u2264 9  \n- Temperature \u2264 2.5\u00b0C  \n- Tipping triggers \u2264 2  \n\n### Individual winner (only if shared win)\nEach player totals **Resilience Score**:\n- +1 per Adaptation token in their region\n- +1 per Infrastructure built (from certain cards)\n- +2 if their Public Support never hit \u201cUnrest\u201d\n- \u22121 per unresolved Impact marker at end\nHighest score wins **\u201cBest Regional Outcome.\u201d**\n\nThis keeps tension but prevents selfish play from being optimal if it risks shared loss.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample round (Round 4 example, 4 players)\n\n**Starting state:**  \nCO\u2082 27, Temp 1.5\u00b0C, Ocean Heat 4, Feedback 3, Tipping Risk 5, Crisis 4.\n\n### 1) Forecast Phase\nNo new forecast this round (it updates every other round). Current model warns: \u201cAt Temp \u22652.0, events +1 severity on 30% chance.\u201d\n\nPlayer C spends 1 Research to peek at next Event: it\u2019s **\u201cCompound Heat + Drought.\u201d** Table groans; they plan adaptation.\n\n### 2) Planning Phase\nEach player commits 2 actions:\n- Player A: plays **Carbon Price** (Mitigation +2, Public Support risk) + **Grid Upgrade** (Mitigation +1 next 2 rounds).\n- Player B: plays **Coastal Defenses** (Adaptation +2) + funds local projects for +1 Adaptation.\n- Player C: plays **Water Efficiency** (Adaptation +2) + **Forest Protection** (\u22121 Feedback if no wildfire this year).\n- Player D: plays **Methane Leak Repair** (\u22121 CO\u2082 this round, \u22121 Feedback) + **Emergency Response** (reduce impact severity by 1 this year).\n\n### 3) Action Phase\nResolve mitigation: total mitigation tokens = 3; plus methane repair reduces CO\u2082 by 1 directly.\n\n### 4) Earth System Phase\n- CO\u2082 Stock: base emissions +4 (for 4 players), minus mitigation 3 \u2192 net +1; then methane repair \u22121 \u2192 **CO\u2082 stays at 27**.\n- Ocean Heat/Delay: since CO\u2082 didn\u2019t drop, add +1 Ocean Heat \u2192 5. Convert 2 heat \u2192 Temp +0.5\u00b0C; Ocean Heat becomes 3; **Temp rises to 2.0\u00b0C** (delay hurts).\n- Temp increase: Tipping Risk +1 \u2192 becomes 6.  \n- Feedback: methane repair reduces Feedback to 2. (Forest protection condition pending.)\n- **Tipping check:** Risk \u22656 \u2192 draw 1 chip from bag: **Yellow (Strain)**. Apply +1 Feedback \u2192 Feedback 3. Remove yellow chip from bag (future risk worse).\n\n### 5) Impact Phase\nReveal Event: **Compound Heat + Drought** (as expected).\n- Roll 2d6 = 9 (high). At Temp 2.0\u00b0C, event severity +1 band (model tail chance triggers on a die roll 4\u20136; they roll a 5) \u2192 severity escalates.\n- Regions take impacts:\n  - Player B\u2019s coastal defenses don\u2019t help drought much; they take 2 heat impacts.\n  - Player C\u2019s water efficiency blocks 1 drought impact; still takes 1.\n  - Player D\u2019s emergency response reduces severity by 1 globally, preventing one crisis point.\n- Because a \u201cheat+drought\u201d occurred, Feedback +1 (reinforcing) \u2192 Feedback 4.\n- Crisis rises by 2 due to unhandled impacts \u2192 Crisis 6.\n\n**End:** Players feel the core lesson: even with mitigation holding CO\u2082 flat, **warming still increased** due to stored heat; compounded impacts and feedback rose; tipping risk started to \u201cload.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide (8\u201312 minutes)\n\n### What to observe (during play)\n- Who argues for mitigation vs adaptation and why?\n- Do players invest in research or treat uncertainty as noise?\n- Do they notice that \u201cholding CO\u2082 steady\u201d didn\u2019t stop warming immediately?\n- How did the tipping risk feel (fair, scary, motivating)?\n\n### Three discussion prompts (use after game)\n1. **Feedback loops and reinforcement**\n   - \u201cName one moment where the game got harder because of a reinforcing loop (e.g., heat \u2192 wildfire \u2192 higher feedback \u2192 worse events). What real-world loop might that represent, and what intervention seemed most effective: prevention (mitigation), buffering (adaptation), or breaking the loop (ecosystem/methane policies)?\u201d\n\n2. **Delay and \u2018why it still got worse\u2019**\n   - \u201cDid you ever implement strong mitigation and still see temperature or impacts worsen next round? What in the game represented the lag, and how does that change what \u2018good policy\u2019 looks like (timing, urgency, sequencing)?\u201d\n\n3. **Uncertainty and decision-making under risk (including tipping)**\n   - \u201cWhen forecasts were uncertain, did you act cautiously, gamble, or invest in research? How did the tipping-risk bag change your behavior compared with a simple linear track? In real climate policy, what are examples of actions that reduce the *probability* of worst-case outcomes even if we can\u2019t predict them precisely?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical note (limits of the model)\n- The game simplifies climate justice, economics, and geopolitics into a shared budget and regional scoring. If your learning goals include equity and responsibility, add a variant where regions have different starting emissions and vulnerability\u2014*but keep powers symmetric* by giving compensating resources and making those differences explicit discussion material, not hidden role advantages.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can provide: a printable one-page rules summary, example Policy/Event/Forecast/Tipping cards (10\u201315 each), and balancing knobs (player-count scaling, difficulty levels, and how to tune the risk bag).",

      "text": "## Alternative framing (to surface assumptions before the design)\nMany \u201cclimate games\u201d accidentally become: **(a)** a trivia quiz, **(b)** a morality tale where \u201cthe right card\u201d always wins, or **(c)** a deterministic engine puzzle with no uncertainty. To teach climate science *through play*, the design should instead make players repeatedly confront four structural realities:\n\n1. **Feedbacks**: actions change the system, which changes future action effectiveness (e.g., permafrost, albedo, ocean uptake).\n2. **Uncertainty**: you never know the exact magnitude/timing of impacts; you manage distributions and risk.\n3. **Tradeoffs**: mitigation vs adaptation compete for limited resources and have different time profiles.\n4. **Delays & lock-in**: emissions and infrastructure persist; early choices constrain later options.\n5. **Nonlinear tipping risk**: risk is *not* linear with temperature; it accelerates after thresholds.\n\nThe game below is built around those realities, not around lecturing or fact recall.\n\n---\n\n# Game: **THRESHOLD**\n**Players:** 3\u20135  \n**Ages:** 12+  \n**Time:** 35\u201350 min  \n**Style:** Mostly cooperative with limited competitive tension (reputation points), no asymmetric \u201cpay-to-win\u201d roles.\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game Objective\nPlayers are the \u201cGlobal Council\u201d coordinating investments over a shared timeline to keep society stable while the climate system responds with delays, uncertainty, and tipping risks.\n\n**Primary objective (shared):**  \nSurvive through Year 2100 with:\n- **Temperature** at or below critical levels *or* with sufficient adaptation to prevent collapse,\n- **Resilience** above zero,\n- And avoid triggering catastrophic **Tipping Points**.\n\n**Secondary objective (light competition):**  \nEach player tracks **Legacy** (public approval/reputation). You want the group to survive, but you also want to be the most effective leader.\n\nLegacy never overrides survival; it only breaks ties if the group succeeds.\n\n---\n\n## (2) Components List\n**Main board (tracks + map):**\n- **Year Track:** 2025 \u2192 2100 in 5-year steps (16 rounds).\n- **Atmospheric Carbon Track (C):** 0\u201330 (abstract \u201cexcess carbon\u201d).\n- **Temperature Track (T):** 0.0\u20134.0\u00b0C in 0.2 steps.\n- **Resilience Track (R):** 0\u201320 (capacity to absorb shocks).\n- **Damage Track (D):** 0\u201320 (cumulative losses).\n- **Tipping Risk Meter:** 0\u201312 with colored zones.\n\n**Tokens:**\n- 1 Carbon marker, 1 Temperature marker, 1 Resilience marker, 1 Damage marker, 1 Tipping marker.\n- 20 **Budget cubes** (generic funds).\n- 15 **Policy tokens** (to mark implemented long-lived policies).\n- 10 **Adaptation shields** (reduce shock impacts).\n- 12 **Feedback tiles** (e.g., Ice-Albedo, Permafrost Methane, Forest Dieback, Ocean Uptake Weakening).\n\n**Cards:**\n- **Project cards (60):** mitigation, adaptation, R&D, governance. Each shows: cost, immediate effects, delayed effects (with \u201cDelay\u201d icon), and uncertainty dice.\n- **Event cards (40):** heatwaves, floods, political shocks, tech breakthroughs, economic cycles.\n- **Tipping cards (8):** irreversible-ish shifts; each alters rules (nonlinear consequences).\n\n**Dice:**\n- 2 six-sided dice (2d6) labeled as **Uncertainty Dice** (standard pips are fine).\n\n**Player aids (5):**\n- Summary of phases, effects timing, and key formulas (very light arithmetic).\n\n**Legacy track:**\n- Individual Legacy markers and a small track (0\u201315).\n\n---\n\n## (3) Setup\n1. Place the board. Set **Year = 2025**, **C = 10**, **T = 1.2\u00b0C**, **R = 10**, **D = 0**, **Tipping Risk = 2**.\n2. Shuffle each deck (Projects, Events, Tipping).\n3. Give each player:\n   - 1 Legacy marker at 0,\n   - 3 Budget cubes.\n4. Place **10 Budget cubes** in a shared pool (\u201cGlobal Budget\u201d).\n5. Reveal **3 Project cards** face-up to form the **Public Agenda**.\n6. Reveal **2 Feedback tiles** at random and place them active (these are baseline feedbacks already \u201cin motion\u201d).\n7. Put all other Feedback tiles in a face-down stack.\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn Structure (each round = 5 years)\nEach round has 6 phases:\n\n1. **Revenue & Public Agenda Refresh**\n2. **Planning (open negotiation)**\n3. **Action (players spend budget & play projects)**\n4. **System Response (delays, feedback loops, carbon \u2192 temperature)**\n5. **Event & Shock Resolution (uncertainty)**\n6. **Tipping Check + End-of-Round Maintenance**\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core Mechanics (how it teaches through play)\n\n### A. Carbon\u2013Temperature with delay (simple but not immediate)\n- Each round, players add **Emissions** to Carbon unless mitigated.\n- Temperature increases based on carbon *and* feedbacks, but with inertia.\n\n**Rule (easy-to-run):**\n1. **Carbon update:**  \n   \\( C \\leftarrow C + E - S \\)  \n   where **E** = baseline emissions this round (starts at 3, can be reduced by mitigation policies) and **S** = sequestration/removal (some projects).\n2. **Temperature update (inertia):**  \n   If \\( C > 0 \\), increase temperature by:  \n   **\u0394T = 0.2\u00b0C** if \\( C \\ge 10 \\), plus **+0.2\u00b0C** if \\( C \\ge 18 \\), plus **+0.2\u00b0C** if \\( C \\ge 24 \\).  \n   Then apply **-0.2\u00b0C** only if carbon falls below 8 (representing slow cooling / hysteresis).\n\nThis creates delayed consequences: even if you cut emissions, temperature doesn\u2019t instantly drop.\n\n### B. Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoff (competing benefits, different timing)\n- **Mitigation projects** reduce baseline emissions (E) or increase S, often with **delayed activation**.\n- **Adaptation projects** add shields and/or increase Resilience, reducing damage from events **immediately**.\n- Many adaptation projects also raise Legacy quickly (visible benefits), while mitigation helps later (and protects tipping risk).\n\nPlayers must decide: do we prevent future harm or cope with near-term shocks?\n\n### C. Uncertainty (not randomness for its own sake)\nMany events and some project outcomes require rolling 2d6 and consulting a small table:\n- 2\u20134: \u201cWorse than expected\u201d\n- 5\u20139: \u201cAs expected\u201d\n- 10\u201312: \u201cBetter than expected\u201d\n\nUncertainty affects:\n- Damage magnitude of extreme events,\n- Effectiveness/timeline of certain technologies,\n- Political/economic headwinds.\n\nPlayers learn to manage risk (buffer Resilience) rather than assume point estimates.\n\n### D. Feedback loops as persistent rule modifiers\nFeedback tiles behave like \u201calways-on\u201d modifiers that can escalate:\n- Example: **Ice\u2013Albedo Feedback**\n  - When T \u2265 1.8\u00b0C: add +1 Tipping Risk per round.\n  - When T \u2265 2.4\u00b0C: also add +1 Carbon per round (loss of reflective ice accelerates warming).\n\nFeedbacks create self-reinforcing dynamics players must anticipate early.\n\n### E. Nonlinear tipping risk mechanic (explicit threshold + accelerating probability)\nThis is the required \u201ctipping\u201d representation.\n\n**Tipping Risk Meter** increases via:\n- Temperature thresholds,\n- Active feedback tiles,\n- Certain events (e.g., mega-droughts),\n- Underinvestment (if Resilience is too low, societal stress increases risk).\n\n**Tipping Check (nonlinear):**\nAt end of each round, roll 2d6:\n- If roll **\u2264 current Tipping Risk**, you draw a **Tipping card** and resolve it.\n- Then reduce Tipping Risk by 2 (society \u201clearns\u201d) *but* increase the **baseline** Tipping Risk by +1 permanently (the system is now closer to other thresholds).\n\nThis is nonlinear because:\n- Risk jumps quickly once the meter rises (probability curve accelerates),\n- Each tipping makes future tipping easier (path dependence).\n\n### F. Limited competitive tension (Legacy) without asymmetry\nPlayers are equal in rules/power. Legacy is earned by:\n- Funding projects that avert damage this round (+1),\n- Passing long-term mitigation that reduces E (+1 when it activates),\n- Maintaining high Resilience at round end (shared success yields +1 to all).\n\nThis creates \u201ccredit claiming\u201d incentives but doesn\u2019t let anyone sabotage without risking a group loss.\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n\n### Group Loss (any time)\n- **Resilience (R) reaches 0**, or\n- **Damage (D) reaches 20**, or\n- **3 Tipping cards** have been triggered (catastrophic cascade), or\n- **Temperature reaches 4.0\u00b0C** (system out of bounds).\n\n### Group Win (end of 2100 round)\n- Still alive (no loss triggered), and\n- **Temperature \u2264 2.0\u00b0C**, *or* Temperature \u2264 2.6\u00b0C with **Resilience \u2265 12** and Damage \u2264 12 (represents \u201cmanageably adapted but not ideal\u201d).\n\n### Individual \u201cWinner\u201d (only if group wins)\nHighest Legacy wins; ties share.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample Round (illustrative)\n**State at start of 2050:**  \nYear 2050, C=18, T=1.8\u00b0C, R=9, D=6, Tipping Risk=6  \nActive feedbacks: Ice\u2013Albedo, Ocean Uptake Weakening\n\n### Phase 1: Revenue & Agenda\n- Add 3 Budget cubes to the shared pool (economic growth).\n- Refresh Public Agenda back to 3 face-up projects.\n\n### Phase 2: Planning\nPlayers discuss: floods are getting worse; temperature is at 1.8\u00b0C (Ice\u2013Albedo threshold). They fear tipping.\n\n### Phase 3: Action\nPlayers collectively spend budget:\n- Fund **\u201cGrid Modernization\u201d** (cost 4): reduces baseline emissions E by 1 **starting next round** (delay).\n- Fund **\u201cCoastal Defenses\u201d** (cost 3): +2 Adaptation shields now, +1 Resilience now.\n- Fund **\u201cForest Protection\u201d** (cost 2): prevents a feedback escalation; if T \u2265 2.0 later, reduce carbon gain from dieback (conditional).\n\nEach player gains some Legacy for sponsoring visible defenses and long-term mitigation (per card text).\n\n### Phase 4: System Response\n- Baseline emissions this round still E=3 (grid isn\u2019t active yet).\n- Ocean Uptake Weakening adds +1 carbon this round (active feedback).  \nCarbon: C = 18 + 3 + 1 = 22\n- Temperature update: C\u226518 implies \u0394T=0.4\u00b0C (0.2 base +0.2 extra), so T becomes **2.2\u00b0C**.\n- Ice\u2013Albedo at T\u22651.8 adds +1 Tipping Risk.  \nTipping Risk: 6 \u2192 7\n\n### Phase 5: Event\nDraw Event: **\u201cOnce-in-50-year Floods\u201d**  \nRoll 2d6 for severity: result = 4 (worse than expected).  \nFlood damage = 4, but players spend 2 Adaptation shields to reduce by 2.  \nDamage D: 6 \u2192 8  \nResilience R: 10 (was 9 +1 from defenses) reduces by remaining 2 shock \u2192 R: 8\n\n### Phase 6: Tipping Check\nRoll 2d6 against Tipping Risk 7: roll = 6 \u2192 tipping triggers.  \nDraw Tipping card: **\u201cPermafrost Methane Pulse\u201d**  \nEffect: add a new Feedback tile \u201cPermafrost Methane\u201d (adds +1 carbon each round if T\u22652.0), and immediately +2 carbon.  \nCarbon: 22 \u2192 24  \nAlso: increase baseline Tipping Risk permanently by +1.\n\nEnd of round: players realize a delayed mitigation policy was too slow; adaptation helped avoid immediate collapse, but feedbacks are now compounding.\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/Facilitator Debrief Guide (10\u201312 minutes)\n### Facilitation goal\nHelp players translate game experiences into climate-science concepts: reinforcing feedbacks, risk management under uncertainty, and intertemporal tradeoffs.\n\n### What to observe during play (notes to self)\n- When did the group start mitigation relative to when temperature accelerated?\n- Did they build buffers (Resilience) or run \u201cjust-in-time\u201d?\n- How did they respond after a tipping card (panic spending vs strategic pivot)?\n- Did anyone over-optimize for Legacy at the expense of system stability?\n\n### Debrief structure\n1. **Reconstruct the timeline** (2\u20133 min): \u201cWhat were the 2\u20133 biggest turning points?\u201d\n2. **Map mechanics \u2192 real concepts** (4\u20135 min): feedback tiles, inertia, event uncertainty, tipping check.\n3. **Counterfactual** (3\u20134 min): \u201cIf you replayed from 2035, what would you do differently and why?\u201d\n\n### Three discussion prompts\n1. **Feedback loops:**  \n   \u201cWhich feedback tile (or tipping card) changed the game the most, and how did it alter the effectiveness of your later choices? What\u2019s the real-world analogue?\u201d\n2. **Uncertainty & risk:**  \n   \u201cWhen you rolled \u2018worse than expected,\u2019 did your strategy already have buffers? If not, what would \u2018building robustness\u2019 look like in real policy terms?\u201d\n3. **Mitigation vs adaptation & delay:**  \n   \u201cName one moment where short-term adaptation prevented immediate harm, but long-term mitigation would have reduced future risk. How did delays in policy activation shape your decisions?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Self-critical notes (design risks + how to handle)\n- **Risk: too many tracks for 12+ in 50 minutes.**  \n  Mitigation: keep arithmetic to 0/1/2 steps; use clear iconography; provide player aids.\n- **Risk: tipping feels arbitrary.**  \n  Mitigation: the nonlinear check is *probabilistic but state-dependent*; always explain which thresholds raised Tipping Risk.\n- **Risk: competitive Legacy incentivizes sabotage.**  \n  Mitigation: forbid actions that directly increase emissions; make Legacy mostly earned through shared success and visible protection.\n\nIf you want, I can also provide: 12 example Project cards, 10 example Event cards, and 4 sample Tipping cards written in full \u201ccard text\u201d form for immediate prototyping.",

If **roll \u2264 Risk**, a **Tipping Event** triggers:\n  - Temperature immediately +2 (no delay), and reveal 1 extra Feedback card.\n\nBecause 2d6 is nonlinear (more likely mid-values), moving Risk from 5\u21927 changes odds a lot.

If roll \u22647, tipping triggers (fairly likely). Suppose roll = 8 \u2192 no tipping (barely).\n\nPlayers leave the round feeling: \u201cWe improved adaptation, but warming and risk climbed anyway\u2014and now a reinforcing loop is live.\u201d\n\n---\n\n# (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide\n\n## Facilitation goals (keep it play-centered)\n- Don\u2019t \u201ccorrect\u201d strategies mid-game; instead ask what they *expected* and what surprised them.\n- Separate **model** from **reality**: the game is a simplified system to surface reasoning patterns.\n\n## Quick debrief structure (8\u201310 minutes)\n1. **Replay the timeline:** What decisions did you make early vs late?\n2. **Identify a loop:** Name one reinforcing/balancing feedback that mattered.\n3. **Talk uncertainty:** Where did you act under uncertainty, and what reduced it?\n\n## Three discussion prompts\n1. **Delay & responsibility:**  \n   \u201cWhich problems were already \u2018locked in\u2019 by the time you responded?

They must:\n- **Mitigate** emissions to keep long-term warming manageable,\n- **Adapt** to near-term impacts that are already \u201clocked in,\u201d\n- Manage **uncertainty** in projections,\n- Avoid crossing **tipping thresholds** that trigger nonlinear escalation.\n\n**Shared objective:** End Round 8 without global collapse and keep global warming under control.  \n**Personal objective (light tension):** Be the player whose region achieves the best **Resilience Score** *while still collectively surviving*.\n\n---\n\n## (2) Components list\n**Board & tracks**\n- 1 Main board with:\n  - **CO\u2082 Stock track** (0\u201340)\n  - **Temperature track** (0.0\u20133.5\u00b0C in 0.5 steps)\n  - **Ocean Heat / Delay track** (0\u20136)\n  - **Feedback track** (0\u20136)\n  - **Tipping Risk meter** (0\u201310) with threshold markers at 6 and 9\n  - **Crisis track** (0\u201312)\n  - 5 **Region panels** (one per player seat): Adaptation, Infrastructure, Public Support, Local Impacts\n\n**Cards**\n- 45 **Policy cards** (mitigation, adaptation, research, nature-based, governance)\n- 30 **Event cards** (storms, heatwaves, droughts, political shocks, tech breakthroughs)\n- 12 **Forecast cards** (probabilistic climate sensitivity & impact ranges)\n- 10 **Tipping cards** (ice sheet loss, permafrost methane pulse, AMOC slowdown, Amazon dieback, etc.)\n\n**Tokens**\n- 60 **Budget cubes** (generic resource)\n- 25 **Mitigation tokens**\n- 25 **Adaptation tokens**\n- 15 **Research tokens**\n- 20 **Resilience markers** (region score)\n- 12 **Impact markers** (flood/heat/fire icons)\n- 1 **Nonlinear Risk bag** with:\n  - 6 green \u201cSafe\u201d chips\n  - 4 yellow \u201cStrain\u201d chips\n  - 2 red \u201cTip\u201d chips\n\n**Dice**\n- 2 six-sided dice (2d6) for impact severity bands (bell-ish curve)\n\n**Player aids**\n- 5 quick-reference sheets explaining icons and the system steps\n\n---\n\n## (3) Setup (7\u201310 minutes)\n1. **Choose regions**: Each player takes one identical region mat (no special powers). Regions differ only in *starting vulnerability profile* (e.g., Coastal, Arid, Forested, Urban) but all are balanced: each gets the same total starting capacity distributed differently.\n2. **Set global tracks**:\n   - CO\u2082 Stock = 20  \n   - Temperature = 1.0\u00b0C  \n   - Ocean Heat/Delay = 3  \n   - Feedback = 1  \n   - Tipping Risk = 2  \n   - Crisis = 0\n3. **Deal starting hands**: Each player draws 4 Policy cards.\n4. **Forecast**: Reveal 1 Forecast card and place it in the \u201cCurrent Model\u201d slot. (It shows an uncertain range, e.g., \u201cAt CO\u2082 30: +0.5 to +1.0\u00b0C by endgame; extreme events +1 level on 30% chance.\u201d)\n5. **Budgets**: Give each player 6 Budget cubes. Put the rest in a supply.\n6. **Event deck**: Shuffle; reveal the top card into the \u201cThis Year Event\u201d slot only when instructed in the round.\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn structure (each Round = 1 \u201cYear\u201d)\nEach round has **five phases**:\n\n1. **Forecast Phase (Uncertainty update)**\n   - Reveal a new Forecast card **every other round** (Rounds 1,3,5,7).\n   - Players may spend **Research tokens** to reduce uncertainty (details below).\n\n2. **Planning Phase (Negotiation + Commit)**\n   - Each player selects **2 Policy cards** to play face-up OR 1 Policy card + \u201cFund Local Projects.\u201d\n   - Players may trade Budget cubes (openly).\n\n3. **Action Phase (Resolve policies)**\n   - Resolve all **Mitigation** effects first, then **Adaptation**, then **Governance/Research**.\n   - Place tokens, adjust region and global tracks.\n\n4. **Earth System Phase (Delayed consequences + feedback loops)**\n   - Update CO\u2082 Stock based on emissions and removals.\n   - Advance Ocean Heat/Delay; convert some stored heat into Temperature.\n   - Apply Feedback track effects (can add CO\u2082 or increase event severity).\n   - Check **Tipping Risk** and possibly draw from the Risk bag (nonlinear tipping).\n\n5. **Impact Phase (Events + damages)**\n   - Reveal the Event card.\n   - Roll 2d6 to determine severity band, modified by Temperature, Feedback, and local vulnerability.\n   - Regions absorb impacts using Adaptation/Infrastructure; leftover impacts raise Crisis and reduce Public Support.\n\nThen start next round.\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core mechanics (how learning happens through play)\n\n### A) Stock-and-flow carbon cycle (mitigation with lag)\n- **CO\u2082 Stock** increases each round by:\n  - Base emissions (depends on player count; e.g., 5 players = +5)\n  - Minus mitigation tokens (each token reduces +1 this round)\n  - Minus removals (some cards add \u201cRemoval\u201d that reduces CO\u2082 Stock directly, but often later)\n- Key: even if players slam mitigation, **Temperature doesn\u2019t immediately drop** because of the delay track.\n\n### B) Delay / thermal inertia\n- The **Ocean Heat/Delay track** collects \u201ccommitted warming.\u201d\n- Each round:\n  - Add +1 to Ocean Heat/Delay if CO\u2082 Stock rose this year (or Temperature is high).\n  - Then convert **2 units of Ocean Heat** into **+0.5\u00b0C Temperature** (until Ocean Heat is low).\n- This creates the felt experience: \u201cWe acted, why is it still getting worse?\u201d\n\n### C) Feedback loops (reinforcing mechanisms)\nThe **Feedback track** increases when:\n- Temperature crosses 1.5\u00b0C (+1 Feedback),\n- A major wildfire/drought event occurs (+1),\n- Tipping events trigger (+2).\n\nFeedback effects each Earth System Phase:\n- Add **+1 CO\u2082** per 2 Feedback (rounded down) *or*\n- Increase Event severity by +1 band at Feedback 4+.\n\nPlayers can lower Feedback with certain cards (ecosystem protection, methane capture, land management), but it\u2019s harder than preventing it.\n\n### D) Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoff (limited budget + local incentives)\n- Budget is tight; each player can usually do **either** a strong mitigation push **or** robust local adaptation in a round, not both.\n- **Personal Resilience Score** rewards local protection and wellbeing.\n- **Shared survival** requires enough mitigation to keep Temperature/tipping under control.\nThis produces real negotiation: \u201cI can\u2019t keep saving my coast every year if nobody cuts emissions.\u201d\n\n### E) Uncertainty as a controllable, not ignorable, factor\nForecast cards show ranges and \u201ctails,\u201d e.g.:\n- \u201cClimate sensitivity: medium; at CO\u2082 35, warming +1.0 to +1.5\u00b0C by end. Extreme events: 20% chance +2 severity at Temp \u22652.0.\u201d\nPlayers can invest in **Research**:\n- Spend 2 Research tokens to **discard one Forecast card in play and draw a new one**, or\n- Spend 1 Research token to **peek at next Event card** (improves planning), or\n- Spend 1 Research token to **remove one yellow chip** from the Risk bag (representing improved monitoring/early action lowering tipping probability).\n\nUncertainty is not just randomness; it\u2019s partially manageable at a cost.\n\n### F) Nonlinear tipping risk mechanic (explicit requirement)\n**Tipping Risk meter + Risk bag draw**:\n- Tipping Risk increases by:\n  - +1 each time Temperature increases\n  - +1 when Feedback increases\n  - +2 if CO\u2082 Stock crosses 30\n- If Tipping Risk hits **6 or more**, during Earth System Phase players draw **1 chip** from the Risk bag:\n  - Green: no tipping\n  - Yellow: \u201cpre-tip strain\u201d \u2192 immediate +1 Feedback and keep chip out (bag becomes riskier later)\n  - Red: **Tipping event triggers** \u2192 draw a Tipping card and resolve it (often adds sudden CO\u2082, raises Temperature cap, or permanently increases event severity)\n- At Tipping Risk **9+**, draw **2 chips** each round.\n\nThis is nonlinear: risk can look stable\u2026 until it suddenly isn\u2019t, and previous yellows \u201cload the dice.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/loss conditions\n\n### Shared loss (any one triggers immediate loss)\n- **Crisis track reaches 12** (societal breakdown).\n- **Temperature reaches 3.5\u00b0C** (catastrophic system).\n- **3 Tipping cards** have triggered (runaway cascade).\n\n### Shared win (check after Round 8)\nPlayers win if:\n- Crisis \u2264 9  \n- Temperature \u2264 2.5\u00b0C  \n- Tipping triggers \u2264 2  \n\n### Individual winner (only if shared win)\nEach player totals **Resilience Score**:\n- +1 per Adaptation token in their region\n- +1 per Infrastructure built (from certain cards)\n- +2 if their Public Support never hit \u201cUnrest\u201d\n- \u22121 per unresolved Impact marker at end\nHighest score wins **\u201cBest Regional Outcome.\u201d**\n\nThis keeps tension but prevents selfish play from being optimal if it risks shared loss.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample round (Round 4 example, 4 players)\n\n**Starting state:**  \nCO\u2082 27, Temp 1.5\u00b0C, Ocean Heat 4, Feedback 3, Tipping Risk 5, Crisis 4.\n\n### 1) Forecast Phase\nNo new forecast this round (it updates every other round). Current model warns: \u201cAt Temp \u22652.0, events +1 severity on 30% chance.\u201d\n\nPlayer C spends 1 Research to peek at next Event: it\u2019s **\u201cCompound Heat + Drought.\u201d** Table groans; they plan adaptation.\n\n### 2) Planning Phase\nEach player commits 2 actions:\n- Player A: plays **Carbon Price** (Mitigation +2, Public Support risk) + **Grid Upgrade** (Mitigation +1 next 2 rounds).\n- Player B: plays **Coastal Defenses** (Adaptation +2) + funds local projects for +1 Adaptation.\n- Player C: plays **Water Efficiency** (Adaptation +2) + **Forest Protection** (\u22121 Feedback if no wildfire this year).\n- Player D: plays **Methane Leak Repair** (\u22121 CO\u2082 this round, \u22121 Feedback) + **Emergency Response** (reduce impact severity by 1 this year).\n\n### 3) Action Phase\nResolve mitigation: total mitigation tokens = 3; plus methane repair reduces CO\u2082 by 1 directly.\n\n### 4) Earth System Phase\n- CO\u2082 Stock: base emissions +4 (for 4 players), minus mitigation 3 \u2192 net +1; then methane repair \u22121 \u2192 **CO\u2082 stays at 27**.\n- Ocean Heat/Delay: since CO\u2082 didn\u2019t drop, add +1 Ocean Heat \u2192 5. Convert 2 heat \u2192 Temp +0.5\u00b0C; Ocean Heat becomes 3; **Temp rises to 2.0\u00b0C** (delay hurts).\n- Temp increase: Tipping Risk +1 \u2192 becomes 6.  \n- Feedback: methane repair reduces Feedback to 2. (Forest protection condition pending.)\n- **Tipping check:** Risk \u22656 \u2192 draw 1 chip from bag: **Yellow (Strain)**. Apply +1 Feedback \u2192 Feedback 3. Remove yellow chip from bag (future risk worse).\n\n### 5) Impact Phase\nReveal Event: **Compound Heat + Drought** (as expected).\n- Roll 2d6 = 9 (high). At Temp 2.0\u00b0C, event severity +1 band (model tail chance triggers on a die roll 4\u20136; they roll a 5) \u2192 severity escalates.\n- Regions take impacts:\n  - Player B\u2019s coastal defenses don\u2019t help drought much; they take 2 heat impacts.\n  - Player C\u2019s water efficiency blocks 1 drought impact; still takes 1.\n  - Player D\u2019s emergency response reduces severity by 1 globally, preventing one crisis point.\n- Because a \u201cheat+drought\u201d occurred, Feedback +1 (reinforcing) \u2192 Feedback 4.\n- Crisis rises by 2 due to unhandled impacts \u2192 Crisis 6.\n\n**End:** Players feel the core lesson: even with mitigation holding CO\u2082 flat, **warming still increased** due to stored heat; compounded impacts and feedback rose; tipping risk started to \u201cload.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide (8\u201312 minutes)\n\n### What to observe (during play)\n- Who argues for mitigation vs adaptation and why?\n- Do players invest in research or treat uncertainty as noise?\n- Do they notice that \u201cholding CO\u2082 steady\u201d didn\u2019t stop warming immediately?\n- How did the tipping risk feel (fair, scary, motivating)?\n\n### Three discussion prompts (use after game)\n1. **Feedback loops and reinforcement**\n   - \u201cName one moment where the game got harder because of a reinforcing loop (e.g., heat \u2192 wildfire \u2192 higher feedback \u2192 worse events). What real-world loop might that represent, and what intervention seemed most effective: prevention (mitigation), buffering (adaptation), or breaking the loop (ecosystem/methane policies)?\u201d\n\n2. **Delay and \u2018why it still got worse\u2019**\n   - \u201cDid you ever implement strong mitigation and still see temperature or impacts worsen next round? What in the game represented the lag, and how does that change what \u2018good policy\u2019 looks like (timing, urgency, sequencing)?\u201d\n\n3. **Uncertainty and decision-making under risk (including tipping)**\n   - \u201cWhen forecasts were uncertain, did you act cautiously, gamble, or invest in research? How did the tipping-risk bag change your behavior compared with a simple linear track? In real climate policy, what are examples of actions that reduce the *probability* of worst-case outcomes even if we can\u2019t predict them precisely?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical note (limits of the model)\n- The game simplifies climate justice, economics, and geopolitics into a shared budget and regional scoring. If your learning goals include equity and responsibility, add a variant where regions have different starting emissions and vulnerability\u2014*but keep powers symmetric* by giving compensating resources and making those differences explicit discussion material, not hidden role advantages.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can provide: a printable one-page rules summary, example Policy/Event/Forecast/Tipping cards (10\u201315 each), and balancing knobs (player-count scaling, difficulty levels, and how to tune the risk bag).",

Current model warns: \u201cAt Temp \u22652.0, events +1 severity on 30% chance.\u201d\n\nPlayer C spends 1 Research to peek at next Event: it\u2019s **\u201cCompound Heat + Drought.\u201d** Table groans; they plan adaptation.\n\n### 2) Planning Phase\nEach player commits 2 actions:\n- Player A: plays **Carbon Price** (Mitigation +2, Public Support risk) + **Grid Upgrade** (Mitigation +1 next 2 rounds).\n- Player B: plays **Coastal Defenses** (Adaptation +2) + funds local projects for +1 Adaptation.\n- Player C: plays **Water Efficiency** (Adaptation +2) + **Forest Protection** (\u22121 Feedback if no wildfire this year).\n- Player D: plays **Methane Leak Repair** (\u22121 CO\u2082 this round, \u22121 Feedback) + **Emergency Response** (reduce impact severity by 1 this year).\n\n### 3) Action Phase\nResolve mitigation: total mitigation tokens = 3; plus methane repair reduces CO\u2082 by 1 directly.\n\n### 4) Earth System Phase\n- CO\u2082 Stock: base emissions +4 (for 4 players), minus mitigation 3 \u2192 net +1; then methane repair \u22121 \u2192 **CO\u2082 stays at 27**.\n- Ocean Heat/Delay: since CO\u2082 didn\u2019t drop, add +1 Ocean Heat \u2192 5. Convert 2 heat \u2192 Temp +0.5\u00b0C; Ocean Heat becomes 3; **Temp rises to 2.0\u00b0C** (delay hurts).\n- Temp increase: Tipping Risk +1 \u2192 becomes 6.  \n- Feedback: methane repair reduces Feedback to 2. (Forest protection condition pending.)\n- **Tipping check:** Risk \u22656 \u2192 draw 1 chip from bag: **Yellow (Strain)**. Apply +1 Feedback \u2192 Feedback 3.

What real-world loop might that represent, and what intervention seemed most effective: prevention (mitigation), buffering (adaptation), or breaking the loop (ecosystem/methane policies)?\u201d\n\n2. **Delay and \u2018why it still got worse\u2019**\n   - \u201cDid you ever implement strong mitigation and still see temperature or impacts worsen next round? What in the game represented the lag, and how does that change what \u2018good policy\u2019 looks like (timing, urgency, sequencing)?\u201d\n\n3. **Uncertainty and decision-making under risk (including tipping)**\n   - \u201cWhen forecasts were uncertain, did you act cautiously, gamble, or invest in research? How did the tipping-risk bag change your behavior compared with a simple linear track? In real climate policy, what are examples of actions that reduce the *probability* of worst-case outcomes even if we can\u2019t predict them precisely?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical note (limits of the model)\n- The game simplifies climate justice, economics, and geopolitics into a shared budget and regional scoring. If your learning goals include equity and responsibility, add a variant where regions have different starting emissions and vulnerability\u2014*but keep powers symmetric* by giving compensating resources and making those differences explicit discussion material, not hidden role advantages.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can provide: a printable one-page rules summary, example Policy/Event/Forecast/Tipping cards (10\u201315 each), and balancing knobs (player-count scaling, difficulty levels, and how to tune the risk bag)."

To teach climate science *through play*, the design should instead make players repeatedly confront four structural realities:\n\n1. **Feedbacks**: actions change the system, which changes future action effectiveness (e.g., permafrost, albedo, ocean uptake).\n2. **Uncertainty**: you never know the exact magnitude/timing of impacts; you manage distributions and risk.\n3. **Tradeoffs**: mitigation vs adaptation compete for limited resources and have different time profiles.\n4. **Delays & lock-in**: emissions and infrastructure persist; early choices constrain later options.\n5. **Nonlinear tipping risk**: risk is *not* linear with temperature; it accelerates after thresholds.\n\nThe game below is built around those realities, not around lecturing or fact recall.\n\n---\n\n# Game: **THRESHOLD**\n**Players:** 3\u20135  \n**Ages:** 12+  \n**Time:** 35\u201350 min  \n**Style:** Mostly cooperative with limited competitive tension (reputation points), no asymmetric \u201cpay-to-win\u201d roles.\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game Objective\nPlayers are the \u201cGlobal Council\u201d coordinating investments over a shared timeline to keep society stable while the climate system responds with delays, uncertainty, and tipping risks.\n\n**Primary objective (shared):**  \nSurvive through Year 2100 with:\n- **Temperature** at or below critical levels *or* with sufficient adaptation to prevent collapse,\n- **Resilience** above zero,\n- And avoid triggering catastrophic **Tipping Points**.\n\n**Secondary objective (light competition):**  \nEach player tracks **Legacy** (public approval/reputation). You want the group to survive, but you also want to be the most effective leader.\n\nLegacy never overrides survival; it only breaks ties if the group succeeds.\n\n---\n\n## (2) Components List\n**Main board (tracks + map):**\n- **Year Track:** 2025 \u2192 2100 in 5-year steps (16 rounds).\n- **Atmospheric Carbon Track (C):** 0\u201330 (abstract \u201cexcess carbon\u201d).\n- **Temperature Track (T):** 0.0\u20134.0\u00b0C in 0.2 steps.\n- **Resilience Track (R):** 0\u201320 (capacity to absorb shocks).\n- **Damage Track (D):** 0\u201320 (cumulative losses).\n- **Tipping Risk Meter:** 0\u201312 with colored zones.\n\n**Tokens:**\n- 1 Carbon marker, 1 Temperature marker, 1 Resilience marker, 1 Damage marker, 1 Tipping marker.\n- 20 **Budget cubes** (generic funds).\n- 15 **Policy tokens** (to mark implemented long-lived policies).\n- 10 **Adaptation shields** (reduce shock impacts).\n- 12 **Feedback tiles** (e.g., Ice-Albedo, Permafrost Methane, Forest Dieback, Ocean Uptake Weakening).\n\n**Cards:**\n- **Project cards (60):** mitigation, adaptation, R&D, governance. Each shows: cost, immediate effects, delayed effects (with \u201cDelay\u201d icon), and uncertainty dice.\n- **Event cards (40):** heatwaves, floods, political shocks, tech breakthroughs, economic cycles.\n- **Tipping cards (8):** irreversible-ish shifts; each alters rules (nonlinear consequences).\n\n**Dice:**\n- 2 six-sided dice (2d6) labeled as **Uncertainty Dice** (standard pips are fine).\n\n**Player aids (5):**\n- Summary of phases, effects timing, and key formulas (very light arithmetic).\n\n**Legacy track:**\n- Individual Legacy markers and a small track (0\u201315).\n\n---\n\n## (3) Setup\n1. Place the board. Set **Year = 2025**, **C = 10**, **T = 1.2\u00b0C**, **R = 10**, **D = 0**, **Tipping Risk = 2**.\n2. Shuffle each deck (Projects, Events, Tipping).\n3. Give each player:\n   - 1 Legacy marker at 0,\n   - 3 Budget cubes.\n4. Place **10 Budget cubes** in a shared pool (\u201cGlobal Budget\u201d).\n5. Reveal **3 Project cards** face-up to form the **Public Agenda**.\n6. Reveal **2 Feedback tiles** at random and place them active (these are baseline feedbacks already \u201cin motion\u201d).\n7. Put all other Feedback tiles in a face-down stack.\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn Structure (each round = 5 years)\nEach round has 6 phases:\n\n1. **Revenue & Public Agenda Refresh**\n2. **Planning (open negotiation)**\n3. **Action (players spend budget & play projects)**\n4. **System Response (delays, feedback loops, carbon \u2192 temperature)**\n5. **Event & Shock Resolution (uncertainty)**\n6. **Tipping Check + End-of-Round Maintenance**\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core Mechanics (how it teaches through play)\n\n### A. Carbon\u2013Temperature with delay (simple but not immediate)\n- Each round, players add **Emissions** to Carbon unless mitigated.\n- Temperature increases based on carbon *and* feedbacks, but with inertia.\n\n**Rule (easy-to-run):**\n1. **Carbon update:**  \n   \\( C \\leftarrow C + E - S \\)  \n   where **E** = baseline emissions this round (starts at 3, can be reduced by mitigation policies) and **S** = sequestration/removal (some projects).\n2. **Temperature update (inertia):**  \n   If \\( C > 0 \\), increase temperature by:  \n   **\u0394T = 0.2\u00b0C** if \\( C \\ge 10 \\), plus **+0.2\u00b0C** if \\( C \\ge 18 \\), plus **+0.2\u00b0C** if \\( C \\ge 24 \\).  \n   Then apply **-0.2\u00b0C** only if carbon falls below 8 (representing slow cooling / hysteresis).\n\nThis creates delayed consequences: even if you cut emissions, temperature doesn\u2019t instantly drop.\n\n### B. Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoff (competing benefits, different timing)\n- **Mitigation projects** reduce baseline emissions (E) or increase S, often with **delayed activation**.\n- **Adaptation projects** add shields and/or increase Resilience, reducing damage from events **immediately**.\n- Many adaptation projects also raise Legacy quickly (visible benefits), while mitigation helps later (and protects tipping risk).\n\nPlayers must decide: do we prevent future harm or cope with near-term shocks?\n\n### C. Uncertainty (not randomness for its own sake)\nMany events and some project outcomes require rolling 2d6 and consulting a small table:\n- 2\u20134: \u201cWorse than expected\u201d\n- 5\u20139: \u201cAs expected\u201d\n- 10\u201312: \u201cBetter than expected\u201d\n\nUncertainty affects:\n- Damage magnitude of extreme events,\n- Effectiveness/timeline of certain technologies,\n- Political/economic headwinds.\n\nPlayers learn to manage risk (buffer Resilience) rather than assume point estimates.\n\n### D. Feedback loops as persistent rule modifiers\nFeedback tiles behave like \u201calways-on\u201d modifiers that can escalate:\n- Example: **Ice\u2013Albedo Feedback**\n  - When T \u2265 1.8\u00b0C: add +1 Tipping Risk per round.\n  - When T \u2265 2.4\u00b0C: also add +1 Carbon per round (loss of reflective ice accelerates warming).\n\nFeedbacks create self-reinforcing dynamics players must anticipate early.\n\n### E. Nonlinear tipping risk mechanic (explicit threshold + accelerating probability)\nThis is the required \u201ctipping\u201d representation.\n\n**Tipping Risk Meter** increases via:\n- Temperature thresholds,\n- Active feedback tiles,\n- Certain events (e.g., mega-droughts),\n- Underinvestment (if Resilience is too low, societal stress increases risk).\n\n**Tipping Check (nonlinear):**\nAt end of each round, roll 2d6:\n- If roll **\u2264 current Tipping Risk**, you draw a **Tipping card** and resolve it.\n- Then reduce Tipping Risk by 2 (society \u201clearns\u201d) *but* increase the **baseline** Tipping Risk by +1 permanently (the system is now closer to other thresholds).\n\nThis is nonlinear because:\n- Risk jumps quickly once the meter rises (probability curve accelerates),\n- Each tipping makes future tipping easier (path dependence).\n\n### F. Limited competitive tension (Legacy) without asymmetry\nPlayers are equal in rules/power. Legacy is earned by:\n- Funding projects that avert damage this round (+1),\n- Passing long-term mitigation that reduces E (+1 when it activates),\n- Maintaining high Resilience at round end (shared success yields +1 to all).\n\nThis creates \u201ccredit claiming\u201d incentives but doesn\u2019t let anyone sabotage without risking a group loss.\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n\n### Group Loss (any time)\n- **Resilience (R) reaches 0**, or\n- **Damage (D) reaches 20**, or\n- **3 Tipping cards** have been triggered (catastrophic cascade), or\n- **Temperature reaches 4.0\u00b0C** (system out of bounds).\n\n### Group Win (end of 2100 round)\n- Still alive (no loss triggered), and\n- **Temperature \u2264 2.0\u00b0C**, *or* Temperature \u2264 2.6\u00b0C with **Resilience \u2265 12** and Damage \u2264 12 (represents \u201cmanageably adapted but not ideal\u201d).\n\n### Individual \u201cWinner\u201d (only if group wins)\nHighest Legacy wins; ties share.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample Round (illustrative)\n**State at start of 2050:**  \nYear 2050, C=18, T=1.8\u00b0C, R=9, D=6, Tipping Risk=6  \nActive feedbacks: Ice\u2013Albedo, Ocean Uptake Weakening\n\n### Phase 1: Revenue & Agenda\n- Add 3 Budget cubes to the shared pool (economic growth).\n- Refresh Public Agenda back to 3 face-up projects.\n\n### Phase 2: Planning\nPlayers discuss: floods are getting worse; temperature is at 1.8\u00b0C (Ice\u2013Albedo threshold). They fear tipping.\n\n### Phase 3: Action\nPlayers collectively spend budget:\n- Fund **\u201cGrid Modernization\u201d** (cost 4): reduces baseline emissions E by 1 **starting next round** (delay).\n- Fund **\u201cCoastal Defenses\u201d** (cost 3): +2 Adaptation shields now, +1 Resilience now.\n- Fund **\u201cForest Protection\u201d** (cost 2): prevents a feedback escalation; if T \u2265 2.0 later, reduce carbon gain from dieback (conditional).\n\nEach player gains some Legacy for sponsoring visible defenses and long-term mitigation (per card text).\n\n### Phase 4: System Response\n- Baseline emissions this round still E=3 (grid isn\u2019t active yet).\n- Ocean Uptake Weakening adds +1 carbon this round (active feedback).  \nCarbon: C = 18 + 3 + 1 = 22\n- Temperature update: C\u226518 implies \u0394T=0.4\u00b0C (0.2 base +0.2 extra), so T becomes **2.2\u00b0C**.\n- Ice\u2013Albedo at T\u22651.8 adds +1 Tipping Risk.  \nTipping Risk: 6 \u2192 7\n\n### Phase 5: Event\nDraw Event: **\u201cOnce-in-50-year Floods\u201d**  \nRoll 2d6 for severity: result = 4 (worse than expected).  \nFlood damage = 4, but players spend 2 Adaptation shields to reduce by 2.  \nDamage D: 6 \u2192 8  \nResilience R: 10 (was 9 +1 from defenses) reduces by remaining 2 shock \u2192 R: 8\n\n### Phase 6: Tipping Check\nRoll 2d6 against Tipping Risk 7: roll = 6 \u2192 tipping triggers.  \nDraw Tipping card: **\u201cPermafrost Methane Pulse\u201d**  \nEffect: add a new Feedback tile \u201cPermafrost Methane\u201d (adds +1 carbon each round if T\u22652.0), and immediately +2 carbon.  \nCarbon: 22 \u2192 24  \nAlso: increase baseline Tipping Risk permanently by +1.\n\nEnd of round: players realize a delayed mitigation policy was too slow; adaptation helped avoid immediate collapse, but feedbacks are now compounding.\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/Facilitator Debrief Guide (10\u201312 minutes)\n### Facilitation goal\nHelp players translate game experiences into climate-science concepts: reinforcing feedbacks, risk management under uncertainty, and intertemporal tradeoffs.\n\n### What to observe during play (notes to self)\n- When did the group start mitigation relative to when temperature accelerated?\n- Did they build buffers (Resilience) or run \u201cjust-in-time\u201d?\n- How did they respond after a tipping card (panic spending vs strategic pivot)?\n- Did anyone over-optimize for Legacy at the expense of system stability?\n\n### Debrief structure\n1. **Reconstruct the timeline** (2\u20133 min): \u201cWhat were the 2\u20133 biggest turning points?\u201d\n2. **Map mechanics \u2192 real concepts** (4\u20135 min): feedback tiles, inertia, event uncertainty, tipping check.\n3. **Counterfactual** (3\u20134 min): \u201cIf you replayed from 2035, what would you do differently and why?\u201d\n\n### Three discussion prompts\n1. **Feedback loops:**  \n   \u201cWhich feedback tile (or tipping card) changed the game the most, and how did it alter the effectiveness of your later choices? What\u2019s the real-world analogue?\u201d\n2. **Uncertainty & risk:**  \n   \u201cWhen you rolled \u2018worse than expected,\u2019 did your strategy already have buffers? If not, what would \u2018building robustness\u2019 look like in real policy terms?\u201d\n3. **Mitigation vs adaptation & delay:**  \n   \u201cName one moment where short-term adaptation prevented immediate harm, but long-term mitigation would have reduced future risk. How did delays in policy activation shape your decisions?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Self-critical notes (design risks + how to handle)\n- **Risk: too many tracks for 12+ in 50 minutes.**  \n  Mitigation: keep arithmetic to 0/1/2 steps; use clear iconography; provide player aids.\n- **Risk: tipping feels arbitrary.**  \n  Mitigation: the nonlinear check is *probabilistic but state-dependent*; always explain which thresholds raised Tipping Risk.\n- **Risk: competitive Legacy incentivizes sabotage.**  \n  Mitigation: forbid actions that directly increase emissions; make Legacy mostly earned through shared success and visible protection.\n\nIf you want, I can also provide: 12 example Project cards, 10 example Event cards, and 4 sample Tipping cards written in full \u201ccard text\u201d form for immediate prototyping."

Place **Committed Warming**: put **one \u201c+1 Temp\u201d marker** into Delay Queue slot 3 (furthest future). (Represents warming already in the pipeline.)\n3. Each player chooses a region mat; distribute **balanced starting kits**:\n   - Everyone gets the same: **Budget 6**, **Resilience 1**, **Adaptation 0**, **PP = 0**.\n   - Regional Vulnerability differs (0\u20133) but is **compensated**:  \n     - Vulnerability 0 starts with Budget 5  \n     - Vulnerability 1 starts with Budget 6  \n     - Vulnerability 2 starts with Budget 7  \n     - Vulnerability 3 starts with Budget 8  \n     This keeps capability roughly balanced.\n4.

Shuffle Feedback deck; place it face-down.\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn structure (each Round = 1 \u201cYear\u201d)\nEach Round has five phases:\n\n1. **Forecast Phase**\n   - Reveal 1 new Event to the Forecast row (keep 2 face-up).  \n   - Add **1 U token** to the Uncertainty pool (max 6).\n\n2. **Planning Phase (simultaneous, then negotiate)**\n   - Each player chooses **2 Projects** from hand to propose (face-up).\n   - Players may negotiate trades: budget support, who funds what, etc.\n\n3. **Action Phase (in turn order)**\n   - On your turn, you may take **two actions**:\n     - **Fund a Project** (pay its cost; apply effects)\n     - **Co-fund** another player\u2019s project (split cost)\n     - **Research** (pay 2 budget: draw 2 Project cards, keep 1; remove 1 U token)\n     - **Prepare** (pay 2 budget: gain 1 Resilience + 1 Adaptation Capacity)\n   - After everyone acts, discard unfunded proposals; refill hands to 4.\n\n4. **Resolution Phase**\n   - **Emissions & removals:** add net Emission tokens to CO\u2082 track.\n   - **Update Temperature via Delay Queue:**  \n     - Shift the Delay Queue one slot forward; apply any \u201c+Temp\u201d markers that reach slot 1.  \n     - Then, based on current CO\u2082, place new \u201c+Temp\u201d markers into slot 3 (details in mechanics).\n   - **Apply Events:** resolve the oldest Forecast Event (the one that\u2019s been visible longer).\n     - Many events roll **2d6 \u00b1 Uncertainty** and compare to thresholds.\n\n5. **Feedback & Tipping Phase**\n   - If Temperature \u2265 certain thresholds, reveal/activate Feedback cards.\n   - Update **Tipping Risk Meter** and check for **Tipping** (nonlinear risk).\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core mechanics (how it teaches the science)\n\n## A) Carbon \u2192 temperature **with delay (committed warming)**\nInstead of immediate temperature changes, warming enters a **3-step Delay Queue**:\n- At end of each Round, compute **Warming Pressure (WP)** from CO\u2082:\n  - CO\u2082 0\u20136: WP = 0  \n  - 7\u201310: WP = 1  \n  - 11\u201314: WP = 2  \n  - 15\u201318: WP = 3  \n  - 19\u201320: WP = 4\n- Place **WP \u201c+1 Temp\u201d markers** into Delay Queue slot 3.\n- Each round, the queue shifts; markers reaching slot 1 raise Temperature.\n\n**Lesson:** even if you cut emissions now, some warming still arrives later.\n\n## B) Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoff\n- **Mitigation Projects** reduce Emissions or add Removal, lowering future WP.\n- **Adaptation/Resilience Projects** reduce **Impact** when events hit *but do not reduce future WP*.\n\n**Lesson:** you can survive impacts for a while without fixing the cause, but risk accumulates.\n\n## C) Uncertainty as a shared, manipulable system\nThere\u2019s a pool of **U tokens** that make events swingier:\n- Many Events say: roll **2d6 + U in pool** (or take highest of two rolls if U\u22654).\n- Players can spend actions to **Research** to remove U (better forecasts/early warning), or play governance projects that reduce U permanently.\n\n**Lesson:** uncertainty isn\u2019t \u201cignorance\u201d; it\u2019s reducible, and it changes decision-making.\n\n## D) Feedback loops (reinforcing and balancing)\nWhen Temperature crosses thresholds, reveal Feedback cards (public and persistent):\n- At Temp 6: reveal 1 Feedback  \n- Temp 8: reveal another  \n- Temp 10: reveal another\nExamples:\n- **Ice-Albedo Loss (Reinforcing):** each time Temp increases, add +1 WP next round.\n- **Carbon Sink Weakening (Reinforcing):** Removal projects remove 1 less.\n- **Efficiency Standards (Balancing):** first Mitigation project each round costs 1 less.\n\n**Lesson:** systems can amplify or dampen change; player choices interact with these.\n\n## E) Nonlinear tipping risk (the explicit nonlinear mechanic)\n**Tipping Risk Meter (0\u201310)** rises with heat and impacts:\n- Each round, increase Risk by:\n  - +1 if Temp \u2265 7\n  - +1 if Temp \u2265 9 (additional)\n  - +1 if Impact \u2265 7\n  - +1 if a Reinforcing Feedback is active\n- Decrease Risk by:\n  - \u20131 if Adaptation Capacity \u2265 7 (resilient systems)\n  - \u20131 if CO\u2082 \u2264 9 (mitigation success)\n\nThen check tipping:\n- Roll **2d6**. If **roll \u2264 Risk**, a **Tipping Event** triggers:\n  - Temperature immediately +2 (no delay), and reveal 1 extra Feedback card.\n\nBecause 2d6 is nonlinear (more likely mid-values), moving Risk from 5\u21927 changes odds a lot. It creates a felt \u201ccliff.\u201d\n\n**Lesson:** tipping points are probabilistic and nonlinear, not smooth.\n\n---\n\n# (6) Win/loss conditions\n\n## Shared loss (everyone loses)\nImmediate loss if any occur:\n- Temperature reaches **12** (runaway crisis in this model), or\n- Impact reaches **12** (societal/ecosystem breakdown), or\n- A Tipping Event triggers while Risk is **10** (system \u201clocks in\u201d instability).\n\n## Shared win (survive)\nIf after Round 6:\n- Temperature \u2264 9 AND Impact \u2264 9  \nthen the group \u201cwins\u201d (managed transition).\n\n## Individual scoring (optional, light tension)\nEach player gains PP by:\n- Completing Development-friendly projects (labeled PP values),\n- Avoiding regional disasters (some Events target high vulnerability regions),\n- Co-funding projects (small PP for collaboration).\nIf the group loses, nobody \u201cwins\u201d regardless of PP.\n\n---\n\n# (7) Sample round (Round 3, 4 players)\n**State at start:** CO\u2082 13, Temp 6, Impact 5, Adaptation Capacity 3, Risk 5, U=4.\n\n### 1) Forecast\n- Reveal Event: **\u201cHeatwave Cluster\u201d** (visible next round).  \nForecast row now has: *\u201cCoastal Storm Season\u201d* (to resolve now), *\u201cHeatwave Cluster\u201d* (next).\n- Add 1 U (cap 6): U becomes 5.\n\n### 2) Planning (players propose)\n- Player A proposes **\u201cOffshore Wind Buildout\u201d** (cost 4, \u20132 E/round).\n- Player B proposes **\u201cUrban Cooling & Health\u201d** (cost 3, +2 Adaptation Capacity, \u20131 Impact when heat events).\n- Player C proposes **\u201cMangrove Restoration\u201d** (cost 2, +1 Removal, +1 Adaptation).\n- Player D proposes **\u201cNatural Gas Bridge\u201d** (cost 2, +2 PP, +1 E now, \u20131 E next round).\n\nNegotiation: Players challenge D: short-term PP vs emissions. D agrees to co-fund Wind if allowed to play Gas Bridge.\n\n### 3) Actions\n- A funds **Offshore Wind** (pays 4).\n- B funds **Urban Cooling** (pays 3).\n- C funds **Mangroves** (pays 2).\n- D funds **Gas Bridge** (pays 2) and co-funds **Wind** with A by paying 1 extra as \u201cgrid integration\u201d add-on (house rule on co-funding) or alternatively uses **Prepare**.\n\n### 4) Resolution\n- Net Emissions: Wind reduces future E, but Gas Bridge adds **+1 E now** \u2192 CO\u2082 +1 (to 14).\n- Delay Queue shifts: a marker hits slot 1 \u2192 Temp +1 (Temp 7).\n- New WP from CO\u2082 14 \u2192 WP=2 markers added to slot 3.\n- Resolve Event **Coastal Storm Season**:\n  - Roll 2d6 + U (5). Suppose roll is 7+5=12 \u2192 severe.\n  - Base Impact +3. But Adaptation Capacity is now 5 (from Urban Cooling) and Mangroves add +1 Adaptation; reduce Impact by 2 \u2192 net +1 Impact. Impact goes 5\u21926.\n\n### 5) Feedback & Tipping\n- Temp is 7: meets threshold (\u22656) \u2192 reveal Feedback: **Ice-Albedo Loss (Reinforcing)**.\n- Update Risk:\n  - Temp\u22657: +1\n  - Reinforcing feedback active: +1\n  - Impact not \u22657: +0  \n  Risk 5\u21927.\n- Tipping check: roll 2d6. If roll \u22647, tipping triggers (fairly likely). Suppose roll = 8 \u2192 no tipping (barely).\n\nPlayers leave the round feeling: \u201cWe improved adaptation, but warming and risk climbed anyway\u2014and now a reinforcing loop is live.\u201d\n\n---\n\n# (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide\n\n## Facilitation goals (keep it play-centered)\n- Don\u2019t \u201ccorrect\u201d strategies mid-game; instead ask what they *expected* and what surprised them.\n- Separate **model** from **reality**: the game is a simplified system to surface reasoning patterns.\n\n## Quick debrief structure (8\u201310 minutes)\n1. **Replay the timeline:** What decisions did you make early vs late?\n2. **Identify a loop:** Name one reinforcing/balancing feedback that mattered.\n3. **Talk uncertainty:** Where did you act under uncertainty, and what reduced it?\n\n## Three discussion prompts\n1. **Delay & responsibility:**  \n   \u201cWhich problems were already \u2018locked in\u2019 by the time you responded? How did the delay queue change what felt \u2018urgent\u2019?\u201d\n2. **Tradeoffs (mitigation vs adaptation):**  \n   \u201cWhen did adaptation feel like the best move\u2014even if it didn\u2019t lower CO\u2082? When did that choice increase long-run risk?\u201d\n3. **Tipping & nonlinear risk:**  \n   \u201cWhat did it feel like when Risk moved from 5 to 7? Did you notice a \u2018cliff\u2019 in outcomes? In real systems, what kinds of tipping elements might behave like that\u2014and what\u2019s different?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical note (limits to acknowledge)\nThis game compresses complex, uneven global dynamics into a single shared system and a few tracks. That simplification is useful for learning feedback/delay/uncertainty, but it can underrepresent politics, equity, and technological constraints. If you want, I can provide an \u201cequity module\u201d (loss-and-damage, differentiated responsibilities) that stays non-pay-to-win while adding realism."

Learning emerges because optimal play requires the same reasoning climate science requires.\n\nThis design assumes:\n- Ages 12+ can handle light probability, delayed effects, and system tracks if the UI is clean.\n- Players can cooperate under pressure without a \u201ctraitor\u201d role; tension comes from scarce resources and differing local priorities.\n- You want *scientific thinking* (uncertainty, nonlinearities) not memorization.\n\n---\n\n# Game: **Tipping Point Council**\n**Players:** 3\u20135  \n**Time:** 35\u201350 min  \n**Type:** Semi-cooperative (shared win/loss) with limited competitive tension via local scoring, no asymmetric roles.\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game objective\nPlayers collectively govern a world region by region over **8 Rounds (Years)**.

Regions differ only in *starting vulnerability profile* (e.g., Coastal, Arid, Forested, Urban) but all are balanced: each gets the same total starting capacity distributed differently.\n2. **Set global tracks**:\n   - CO\u2082 Stock = 20  \n   - Temperature = 1.0\u00b0C  \n   - Ocean Heat/Delay = 3  \n   - Feedback = 1  \n   - Tipping Risk = 2  \n   - Crisis = 0\n3. **Deal starting hands**: Each player draws 4 Policy cards.\n4. **Forecast**: Reveal 1 Forecast card and place it in the \u201cCurrent Model\u201d slot. (It shows an uncertain range, e.g., \u201cAt CO\u2082 30: +0.5 to +1.0\u00b0C by endgame; extreme events +1 level on 30% chance.\u201d)\n5. **Budgets**: Give each player 6 Budget cubes. Put the rest in a supply.\n6. **Event deck**: Shuffle; reveal the top card into the \u201cThis Year Event\u201d slot only when instructed in the round.\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn structure (each Round = 1 \u201cYear\u201d)\nEach round has **five phases**:\n\n1. **Forecast Phase (Uncertainty update)**\n   - Reveal a new Forecast card **every other round** (Rounds 1,3,5,7).\n   - Players may spend **Research tokens** to reduce uncertainty (details below).\n\n2. **Planning Phase (Negotiation + Commit)**\n   - Each player selects **2 Policy cards** to play face-up OR 1 Policy card + \u201cFund Local Projects.\u201d\n   - Players may trade Budget cubes (openly).\n\n3. **Action Phase (Resolve policies)**\n   - Resolve all **Mitigation** effects first, then **Adaptation**, then **Governance/Research**.\n   - Place tokens, adjust region and global tracks.\n\n4. **Earth System Phase (Delayed consequences + feedback loops)**\n   - Update CO\u2082 Stock based on emissions and removals.\n   - Advance Ocean Heat/Delay; convert some stored heat into Temperature.\n   - Apply Feedback track effects (can add CO\u2082 or increase event severity).\n   - Check **Tipping Risk** and possibly draw from the Risk bag (nonlinear tipping).\n\n5. **Impact Phase (Events + damages)**\n   - Reveal the Event card.\n   - Roll 2d6 to determine severity band, modified by Temperature, Feedback, and local vulnerability.\n   - Regions absorb impacts using Adaptation/Infrastructure; leftover impacts raise Crisis and reduce Public Support.\n\nThen start next round.\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core mechanics (how learning happens through play)\n\n### A) Stock-and-flow carbon cycle (mitigation with lag)\n- **CO\u2082 Stock** increases each round by:\n  - Base emissions (depends on player count; e.g., 5 players = +5)\n  - Minus mitigation tokens (each token reduces +1 this round)\n  - Minus removals (some cards add \u201cRemoval\u201d that reduces CO\u2082 Stock directly, but often later)\n- Key: even if players slam mitigation, **Temperature doesn\u2019t immediately drop** because of the delay track.\n\n### B) Delay / thermal inertia\n- The **Ocean Heat/Delay track** collects \u201ccommitted warming.\u201d\n- Each round:\n  - Add +1 to Ocean Heat/Delay if CO\u2082 Stock rose this year (or Temperature is high).\n  - Then convert **2 units of Ocean Heat** into **+0.5\u00b0C Temperature** (until Ocean Heat is low).\n- This creates the felt experience: \u201cWe acted, why is it still getting worse?\u201d\n\n### C) Feedback loops (reinforcing mechanisms)\nThe **Feedback track** increases when:\n- Temperature crosses 1.5\u00b0C (+1 Feedback),\n- A major wildfire/drought event occurs (+1),\n- Tipping events trigger (+2).\n\nFeedback effects each Earth System Phase:\n- Add **+1 CO\u2082** per 2 Feedback (rounded down) *or*\n- Increase Event severity by +1 band at Feedback 4+.\n\nPlayers can lower Feedback with certain cards (ecosystem protection, methane capture, land management), but it\u2019s harder than preventing it.\n\n### D) Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoff (limited budget + local incentives)\n- Budget is tight; each player can usually do **either** a strong mitigation push **or** robust local adaptation in a round, not both.\n- **Personal Resilience Score** rewards local protection and wellbeing.\n- **Shared survival** requires enough mitigation to keep Temperature/tipping under control.\nThis produces real negotiation: \u201cI can\u2019t keep saving my coast every year if nobody cuts emissions.\u201d\n\n### E) Uncertainty as a controllable, not ignorable, factor\nForecast cards show ranges and \u201ctails,\u201d e.g.:\n- \u201cClimate sensitivity: medium; at CO\u2082 35, warming +1.0 to +1.5\u00b0C by end. Extreme events: 20% chance +2 severity at Temp \u22652.0.\u201d\nPlayers can invest in **Research**:\n- Spend 2 Research tokens to **discard one Forecast card in play and draw a new one**, or\n- Spend 1 Research token to **peek at next Event card** (improves planning), or\n- Spend 1 Research token to **remove one yellow chip** from the Risk bag (representing improved monitoring/early action lowering tipping probability).\n\nUncertainty is not just randomness; it\u2019s partially manageable at a cost.\n\n### F) Nonlinear tipping risk mechanic (explicit requirement)\n**Tipping Risk meter + Risk bag draw**:\n- Tipping Risk increases by:\n  - +1 each time Temperature increases\n  - +1 when Feedback increases\n  - +2 if CO\u2082 Stock crosses 30\n- If Tipping Risk hits **6 or more**, during Earth System Phase players draw **1 chip** from the Risk bag:\n  - Green: no tipping\n  - Yellow: \u201cpre-tip strain\u201d \u2192 immediate +1 Feedback and keep chip out (bag becomes riskier later)\n  - Red: **Tipping event triggers** \u2192 draw a Tipping card and resolve it (often adds sudden CO\u2082, raises Temperature cap, or permanently increases event severity)\n- At Tipping Risk **9+**, draw **2 chips** each round.\n\nThis is nonlinear: risk can look stable\u2026 until it suddenly isn\u2019t, and previous yellows \u201cload the dice.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/loss conditions\n\n### Shared loss (any one triggers immediate loss)\n- **Crisis track reaches 12** (societal breakdown).\n- **Temperature reaches 3.5\u00b0C** (catastrophic system).\n- **3 Tipping cards** have triggered (runaway cascade).\n\n### Shared win (check after Round 8)\nPlayers win if:\n- Crisis \u2264 9  \n- Temperature \u2264 2.5\u00b0C  \n- Tipping triggers \u2264 2  \n\n### Individual winner (only if shared win)\nEach player totals **Resilience Score**:\n- +1 per Adaptation token in their region\n- +1 per Infrastructure built (from certain cards)\n- +2 if their Public Support never hit \u201cUnrest\u201d\n- \u22121 per unresolved Impact marker at end\nHighest score wins **\u201cBest Regional Outcome.\u201d**\n\nThis keeps tension but prevents selfish play from being optimal if it risks shared loss.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample round (Round 4 example, 4 players)\n\n**Starting state:**  \nCO\u2082 27, Temp 1.5\u00b0C, Ocean Heat 4, Feedback 3, Tipping Risk 5, Crisis 4.\n\n### 1) Forecast Phase\nNo new forecast this round (it updates every other round). Current model warns: \u201cAt Temp \u22652.0, events +1 severity on 30% chance.\u201d\n\nPlayer C spends 1 Research to peek at next Event: it\u2019s **\u201cCompound Heat + Drought.\u201d** Table groans; they plan adaptation.\n\n### 2) Planning Phase\nEach player commits 2 actions:\n- Player A: plays **Carbon Price** (Mitigation +2, Public Support risk) + **Grid Upgrade** (Mitigation +1 next 2 rounds).\n- Player B: plays **Coastal Defenses** (Adaptation +2) + funds local projects for +1 Adaptation.\n- Player C: plays **Water Efficiency** (Adaptation +2) + **Forest Protection** (\u22121 Feedback if no wildfire this year).\n- Player D: plays **Methane Leak Repair** (\u22121 CO\u2082 this round, \u22121 Feedback) + **Emergency Response** (reduce impact severity by 1 this year).\n\n### 3) Action Phase\nResolve mitigation: total mitigation tokens = 3; plus methane repair reduces CO\u2082 by 1 directly.\n\n### 4) Earth System Phase\n- CO\u2082 Stock: base emissions +4 (for 4 players), minus mitigation 3 \u2192 net +1; then methane repair \u22121 \u2192 **CO\u2082 stays at 27**.\n- Ocean Heat/Delay: since CO\u2082 didn\u2019t drop, add +1 Ocean Heat \u2192 5. Convert 2 heat \u2192 Temp +0.5\u00b0C; Ocean Heat becomes 3; **Temp rises to 2.0\u00b0C** (delay hurts).\n- Temp increase: Tipping Risk +1 \u2192 becomes 6.  \n- Feedback: methane repair reduces Feedback to 2. (Forest protection condition pending.)\n- **Tipping check:** Risk \u22656 \u2192 draw 1 chip from bag: **Yellow (Strain)**. Apply +1 Feedback \u2192 Feedback 3. Remove yellow chip from bag (future risk worse).\n\n### 5) Impact Phase\nReveal Event: **Compound Heat + Drought** (as expected).\n- Roll 2d6 = 9 (high). At Temp 2.0\u00b0C, event severity +1 band (model tail chance triggers on a die roll 4\u20136; they roll a 5) \u2192 severity escalates.\n- Regions take impacts:\n  - Player B\u2019s coastal defenses don\u2019t help drought much; they take 2 heat impacts.\n  - Player C\u2019s water efficiency blocks 1 drought impact; still takes 1.\n  - Player D\u2019s emergency response reduces severity by 1 globally, preventing one crisis point.\n- Because a \u201cheat+drought\u201d occurred, Feedback +1 (reinforcing) \u2192 Feedback 4.\n- Crisis rises by 2 due to unhandled impacts \u2192 Crisis 6.\n\n**End:** Players feel the core lesson: even with mitigation holding CO\u2082 flat, **warming still increased** due to stored heat; compounded impacts and feedback rose; tipping risk started to \u201cload.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide (8\u201312 minutes)\n\n### What to observe (during play)\n- Who argues for mitigation vs adaptation and why?\n- Do players invest in research or treat uncertainty as noise?\n- Do they notice that \u201cholding CO\u2082 steady\u201d didn\u2019t stop warming immediately?\n- How did the tipping risk feel (fair, scary, motivating)?\n\n### Three discussion prompts (use after game)\n1. **Feedback loops and reinforcement**\n   - \u201cName one moment where the game got harder because of a reinforcing loop (e.g., heat \u2192 wildfire \u2192 higher feedback \u2192 worse events). What real-world loop might that represent, and what intervention seemed most effective: prevention (mitigation), buffering (adaptation), or breaking the loop (ecosystem/methane policies)?\u201d\n\n2. **Delay and \u2018why it still got worse\u2019**\n   - \u201cDid you ever implement strong mitigation and still see temperature or impacts worsen next round? What in the game represented the lag, and how does that change what \u2018good policy\u2019 looks like (timing, urgency, sequencing)?\u201d\n\n3. **Uncertainty and decision-making under risk (including tipping)**\n   - \u201cWhen forecasts were uncertain, did you act cautiously, gamble, or invest in research? How did the tipping-risk bag change your behavior compared with a simple linear track? In real climate policy, what are examples of actions that reduce the *probability* of worst-case outcomes even if we can\u2019t predict them precisely?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical note (limits of the model)\n- The game simplifies climate justice, economics, and geopolitics into a shared budget and regional scoring. If your learning goals include equity and responsibility, add a variant where regions have different starting emissions and vulnerability\u2014*but keep powers symmetric* by giving compensating resources and making those differences explicit discussion material, not hidden role advantages.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can provide: a printable one-page rules summary, example Policy/Event/Forecast/Tipping cards (10\u201315 each), and balancing knobs (player-count scaling, difficulty levels, and how to tune the risk bag)."

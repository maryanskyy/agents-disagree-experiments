That risks teaching \u201cwe\u2019re doomed no matter what,\u201d which is both bad pedagogy and bad game feel.\n2. **Stress and damage may cascade too deterministically.** If S rises almost every round by fixed thresholds, adaptation becomes mandatory and repetitive rather than a strategic choice.\n3. **Tipping choice by players is thematically odd.** In reality you don\u2019t \u201cpick\u201d which tipping point happens. Players can influence *risk*, not select the outcome. Let the system select randomly (with some conditioning), while still letting players manage exposure.\n4. **\u201cInertia bonus carbon if net > 0\u201d** is a bit arbitrary. Better to model *lag* as a separate \u201cHeat in the Pipeline\u201d track or queued emissions.\n5. **Competitive tension is okay but could be cleaner.** A single shared \u201cGlobal Budget\u201d or \u201cPolitical Will\u201d pool can create real negotiation tradeoffs without asymmetric roles.\n\nBelow is a revised, tighter design that preserves the best ideas but fixes the runaway pacing, makes tipping feel more realistic, and ensures multiple viable strategies.\n\n---\n\n# Game: **Thresholds: Feedback**\n\n**Ages:** 12+  \n**Players:** 3\u20135 (no asymmetric roles; all regions identical)  \n**Time:** 35\u201350 minutes  \n**Style:** Semi-cooperative systems strategy (cooperative survival + light competitive sustainability scoring)\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game objective\nOver **7 rounds** (each = ~10 years), players govern regions in a shared climate system. The table must:\n- Keep **Warming** and **Stress** below collapse levels,\n- Avoid **cascading tipping points**,\n- Maintain minimum **human well-being** in every region.\n\nPlayers must reason about:\n- **Feedback loops** (lock-in, albedo/methane, resilience)\n- **Uncertainty** (forecast + probabilistic impacts)\n- **Mitigation vs. adaptation** (short-term protection vs. long-term risk)\n- **Delayed consequences** (emissions commitments, warming lag)\n- **Nonlinear tipping** (risk accelerates after thresholds)\n\n---\n\n## (2) Components list\n\n### Boards & tracks\n- **Main board** with tracks:\n  - **Atmospheric Carbon (C):** 0\u201320\n  - **Warming (W):** 0\u20136\n  - **System Stress (S):** 0\u201310\n  - **Heat in the Pipeline (H):** 0\u20136 (delayed warming)\n  - **Tipping Risk (TR):** 0\u20136 (risk multiplier)\n  - **Round:** 1\u20137\n- **3\u20135 identical Region boards**, each with:\n  - **Well-Being (WB):** 0\u201312\n  - **Resilience (R):** 0\u20138\n  - **Emissions (E):** 0\u20136\n  - **Lock-in (L):** 0\u20136 (infrastructure/political inertia)\n  - **3 Policy slots** (ongoing projects)\n\n### Cards\n- **Project deck (70 cards)** shared by all:\n  - Mitigation, Adaptation, Development, Mixed\n  - Some are **Delayed**, some create/remove **Lock-in**\n- **Event deck (45 cards)**:\n  - Climate variability + economic/policy shocks\n  - Many include **Forecast icons** and **uncertainty ranges**\n\n### Tokens & dice\n- Budget tokens (\u201cCapacity\u201d): ~90\n- Damage tokens: ~60\n- Carbon tokens: ~40 (or use track only)\n- **Uncertainty markers (\u201c?\u201d):** ~20\n- **Tipping tiles (6):** Ice Albedo, Permafrost Methane, Forest Dieback, Monsoon Shift, AMOC Slowdown, Coral Collapse\n- **Risk die (custom d6):** 0,0,1,1,2,3\n\n---\n\n## (3) Setup\n1. Set global tracks:\n   - **C = 8**, **W = 1**, **S = 2**, **H = 2**, **TR = 0**, Round = 1.\n2. Each player takes an identical Region board and sets:\n   - **WB = 6**, **R = 2**, **E = 3**, **L = 2**.\n3. Shuffle **Project** deck; each player draws **5**, keeps **3**, discards 2 face-up (creates early meta-information; reduces analysis paralysis later).\n4. Shuffle **Event** deck; reveal **2 events** into an **Outlook** row (face-up).\n5. Place **6 tipping tiles** face-up. Put them in a fixed order of reveal (A\u2013F) *or* shuffle into a facedown stack (recommended).\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn structure (each round)\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Outlook (Forecast)\n- Reveal 1 new Event into Outlook so there are always **2 face-up upcoming**.\n- If an Event shows a **? icon**, place a **? marker** on W, S, or a specific region as instructed (it will resolve later).\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Budget & Negotiation (2\u20133 minutes)\n- Each player gains **5 Budget**.\n- Plus **+1 Budget if WB \u2265 9** (prosperity increases capacity).\n- Players may make **one deal each**: trade Budget *or* commit to a joint project (\u201cI\u2019ll pay 2 if you play coastal defenses\u201d).\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Plan (simultaneous)\nEach player chooses **up to 2 Projects** to fund and (if ongoing) slot into Policy slots. Unfunded cards stay in hand.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Act (in turn order)\nExecute funded projects:\n- Adjust E, R, WB, L, remove damage, add ongoing effects, etc.\n- Some projects add **Commitment**: \u201cPlace 1 token on H\u201d (e.g., slow-to-deploy infrastructure) or \u201cRemove 1 from L\u201d (de-locking reform).\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Climate response (system update)\nThis is where delay + feedback live.\n\n1. **Emissions \u2192 Carbon (C)**\n   - Increase C by: **ceil( (\u03a3E + \u03a3L) / number of players )**\n   - Then subtract **Removal** from active mitigation projects (usually 0\u20132).\n   - Why this works: Lock-in raises effective emissions; averaging prevents 5-player games from auto-dooming.\n\n2. **Carbon \u2192 Heat in Pipeline (H)**\n   - If **C \u2265 12**, add **+1 H**.\n   - If **C \u2265 16**, add **another +1 H** (nonlinear).\n\n3. **Heat in Pipeline \u2192 Warming (W) (delay)**\n   - Convert **2 H into +1 W**, then reduce H by 2 (minimum 0).\n   - This models committed warming that arrives later even if emissions fall.\n\n4. **Warming \u2192 Stress (S) (with threshold jumps)**\n   - Increase S by:\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 2**\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 4**\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 5**\n   - Then resolve any Event effects on S/W (including ? markers).\n\n### Phase F \u2014 Impacts, tipping, and recovery\n1. **Impacts (regional)**\n   - Each region takes **Damage = max(0, S \u2212 R)**.\n   - For every **2 Damage**, choose one:\n     - **WB \u22121** (social/health costs), or\n     - **L +1** (rebuilding lock-in), or\n     - **E +1** (emergency fossil fallback)\n   - This choice is a key teaching moment: damage creates *policy traps*.\n\n2. **Tipping check (nonlinear tipping risk mechanic)**\n   - If **W \u2265 4**, do a tipping check:\n     - Roll Risk die + TR.\n     - If result **\u2265 4**, trigger the **top tipping tile** (or random tile).\n   - **TR increases** by:\n     - **+1 whenever W increases**, and\n     - **+1 if C \u2265 16** (high carbon raises background risk).\n   - Triggered tipping tiles add permanent effects (examples):\n     - *Ice Albedo:* whenever W \u2265 4, S gets +1 each round.\n     - *Permafrost:* C increases +1 each round (reinforcing loop).\n     - *Forest Dieback:* removal effects are \u22121 weaker (sink degradation).\n\n3. **Recovery**\n   - Each player may spend up to **2 Budget** to:\n     - remove 1 Damage, or\n     - +1 WB, or\n     - reduce L by 1 (costly reform).\n\nAdvance Round, rotate first player.\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core mechanics (what teaches what)\n\n- **Feedback loops**\n  - Reinforcing: Damage \u2192 Lock-in/E fallback \u2192 higher C \u2192 higher W \u2192 higher S \u2192 more Damage.\n  - Balancing: Higher WB \u2192 more Budget \u2192 more mitigation/adaptation \u2192 lower future damages.\n- **Uncertainty**\n  - Two-card forecast encourages planning, but \u201c?\u201d markers turn into a roll later (uncertainty is time-shifted, not absent).\n- **Mitigation vs adaptation**\n  - Adaptation raises R and reduces Damage now.\n  - Mitigation reduces E/C/H, but H can still \u201ccash out\u201d into W later.\n- **Delayed consequences**\n  - H track explicitly stores \u201cwarming owed,\u201d so players feel the lag.\n- **Nonlinear tipping risk**\n  - Tipping only starts at W\u22654, then accelerates with TR and carbon thresholds.\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/loss conditions\n\n### Immediate collective loss if any occurs\n- **W = 6**, or\n- **S = 10**, or\n- **3 tipping tiles triggered**, or\n- Any **one region** reaches **WB = 0** (political/system collapse spillover).\n\n### Collective win (end of Round 7) if all true\n- **W \u2264 4**\n- **S \u2264 7**\n- **Tipping triggered \u2264 1**\n- Every region has **WB \u2265 4**\n\n### Light competitive scoring (only if the table wins)\nEach player score:\n- +WB (final)\n- +R (final)\n- \u2212L (final)\n- \u2212E (final)\nHighest is \u201cBest Transition,\u201d but only after collective survival.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample round (4 players)\n\n**Start of Round 4:** C=13, W=3, H=3, S=4, TR=1  \nRegions (A\u2013D): E = 3/2/4/3, L = 2/3/2/2, R varies.\n\n**Outlook:**  \n- Event 1 (this round): \u201cHeatwave uncertainty: place ? on S (adds +0 to +2 later).\u201d  \n- Event 2 (next): \u201cSupply crunch: first mitigation project costs +1.\u201d\n\n**Budget:** each gets 5 (no one at WB\u22659).\n\n**Projects chosen:**\n- A: Efficiency retrofit (E\u22121 now), Clinics (WB+1, R+1 delayed)\n- B: Coastal defenses (R+2), Fossil subsidy rollback (L\u22121, WB\u22121 now)\n- C: Industrial expansion (WB+2, E+1, L+1)\n- D: Renewables buildout (Delayed: E\u22122 next round; L+1 now)\n\n**Climate response:**\n1) \u03a3E= (2+2+5+3)=12; \u03a3L=(2+2+3+3)=10  \nAdd to C: ceil((12+10)/4)=ceil(22/4)=6 \u2192 C becomes 19 (minus any removal; assume 1) \u2192 C=18  \n2) C\u226512 \u2192 H+1; C\u226516 \u2192 H+1 (H was 3 \u2192 now 5)  \n3) Convert H: 2H \u2192 +1W, H\u22122. H=5 gives W+2? No: convert once per round: **2H \u2192 +1W** (keeps pacing sane). So W becomes 4, H becomes 3.  \n4) W=4 adds +1 (W\u22652) and +1 (W\u22654): S +2 (S goes 4\u21926)  \nResolve \u201c?\u201d on S: roll risk die =2 \u2192 S becomes 8.\n\n**Impacts:**\nDamage = S \u2212 R. Players with low R get hammered; each 2 Damage forces a hard choice (WB hit vs lock-in vs emissions fallback).\n\n**Tipping check (W\u22654):**\nRoll risk die (say 1) + TR(1) = 2 \u2192 no tipping.  \nBut TR increases because W increased: TR becomes 2.\n\nPlayers experience: even if they cut E now, **H still pushes W up**, and **the moment W hits 4 the game\u2019s character changes** (stress jumps + tipping becomes a real threat).\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide (10 minutes)\n\n### What to surface explicitly\n- Players were doing \u201cpolicy under constraints,\u201d not solving a puzzle.\n- The game is biased toward **systems thinking**: actions are less important than *loops, delays, thresholds,* and *robust decisions under uncertainty.*\n\n### Three discussion prompts\n1. **Delay & committed change**\n   - \u201cDid you ever reduce emissions but still see warming rise? What did the Heat-in-the-Pipeline track represent in real life?\u201d\n2. **Tradeoffs: mitigation vs adaptation**\n   - \u201cWhich felt more urgent in play\u2014reducing E/C or raising R/WB? When did adaptation feel like relief, and when did it feel like postponing the problem?\u201d\n3. **Tipping and nonlinear risk**\n   - \u201cWhat changed in your decision-making once W hit 4 and tipping checks began? Did you switch strategies (hedging, cooperation, \u2018panic mitigation\u2019), and why?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical facilitation notes (to avoid wrong takeaways)\n- If students conclude \u201crandomness decides everything,\u201d point out: **uncertainty changed outcomes, but choices changed the odds and the system state** (TR, H, R).\n- If students conclude \u201cdevelopment is always bad,\u201d highlight that **WB increases capacity** (budgets) and can enable later mitigation\u2014*but* lock-in can erase that benefit.\n\n--- \n\nIf you want printable support, I can provide **12 example Project cards + 10 Event cards + 6 tipping tile texts** tuned to keep typical games inside the 35\u201350 minute window without inevitable collapse.",

If carbon is both \u201ctotal stock\u201d *and* receives large annual additions, temp can spike too quickly, making many games unwinnable (or making mitigation feel pointless). We should **separate \u201cannual emissions\u201d from \u201catmospheric stock\u201d** and add **natural uptake** so mitigation is meaningful.\n- **Ambiguity in event scope:** \u201cGlobal stress\u201d vs regional effects need a clean rule so resolution is fast and fair.\n- **Competitive tension risk:** Trust-as-score is fine, but must not incentivize sabotage. Ensure Trust is earned mainly by **verifiable contribution + local protection**, not by letting others fail.\n- **Complexity budget:** 12+ can handle it, but 35\u201350 minutes requires streamlined phases and limited per-turn choices.\n\nBelow is a revised, play-ready version that keeps the best ideas and patches the risks.\n\n---\n\n# **Game: Lag & Leverage (Revised)**  \n**Players:** 3\u20135 | **Time:** 35\u201350 min | **Ages:** 12+ | **Style:** Cooperative with light \u201ccredit\u201d scoring\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game Objective\n**Collective objective:** Finish **8 Years** without triggering global collapse by keeping:\n- **Warming** under control,\n- **Societal Stress** manageable,\n- and **Tipping Points** limited.\n\n**Personal objective (only if the group survives):** Have the most **Trust** (public/political capital).

Set Planet Board:\n   - **Temperature = 1.2\u00b0C**\n   - **CO\u2082 Stock = 12**\n   - **Annual Emissions = 9** (this is the starting global flow)\n   - **Global Stress = 4**\n   - **Tipping Risk = 2**\n2. Each chosen Region starts:\n   - Resilience 2, Wellbeing 7, Trust 5, Innovation 0\n3. Shuffle decks:\n   - Reveal **5 Policy cards** to the **Market**\n   - Shuffle Event deck; reveal **Year 1 Event**\n   - Feedback and Tipping decks face down\n4. Put all uncertainty cubes in the bag.\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn Structure (each Year)\nEach Year has five fast phases.\n\n### A) Forecast (1 minute)\n- Reveal this Year\u2019s **Event**.\n- Draw **2 cubes** from the bag onto the Event (they modify severity).\n- Players may spend **1 Innovation** (anyone) to draw **one extra cube and choose 2 of 3** to use (represents improved forecasting).\n\n### B) Commit (2\u20134 minutes)\nIn turn order, each player takes **2 Actions**, chosen from:\n1. **Buy 1 Policy** from the Market (free) into hand  \n2. **Play 1 Policy** from hand (pay Trust cost if listed)\n3. **Invest Locally:** pay 1 Trust \u2192 gain +1 Resilience *or* +1 Wellbeing (cap 10)\n4. **Coordinate:** spend 1 Trust \u2192 another player gains 1 Trust (represents coalition-building)\n5. **Emergency Response:** pay 2 Trust \u2192 reduce your region\u2019s event impact by 2 this year (cannot reduce below 0)\n\n*(Hard cap: max 2 Policies played per player per year to keep time bounded.)*\n\n### C) System Update: emissions \u2192 CO\u2082 \u2192 temperature (2 minutes)\n1. **Apply mitigation:** Policies reduce **Annual Emissions** now or after a **Lag** (place a \u201cConstruction\u201d marker in an infrastructure slot; it flips when complete).\n2. **Add CO\u2082 stock:** CO\u2082 Stock += Annual Emissions.\n3. **Natural uptake:** CO\u2082 Stock \u2212= **2** each year (minimum 0).  \n   - Some Feedback cards can weaken this uptake (teaches sink saturation risk).\n\n4. **Temperature update:** For every **4 CO\u2082 Stock above 10**, increase Temperature by **+0.1\u00b0C** (rounded down).  \n   - Feedback cards can worsen this conversion (albedo, water vapor, etc.).\n\n### D) Event Resolution (3\u20135 minutes)\n- The Event has a **Base Stress** and **Local Harm** number.\n- Modify with:\n  - the two uncertainty cubes (green +0, yellow +1, red +3),\n  - temperature scaling (e.g., if Temp \u22652.0, +2),\n  - each region\u2019s Resilience (each Resilience reduces that region\u2019s local harm by 1, to min 0).\n- Apply:\n  - **Global Stress** increases by Event Stress.\n  - Each region loses **Wellbeing** equal to its local harm (to min 0).\n  - Regions that hit Wellbeing 0 add **+1 Global Stress** (social instability spillover).\n\n### E) Checks (1\u20132 minutes)\n1. **Feedback thresholds:** If Temp crosses **1.6 / 2.0 / 2.4\u00b0C** or Stress crosses **10 / 14**, reveal a Feedback card and apply permanently.\n2. **Nonlinear tipping risk:**  \n   - Increase Tipping Risk by:\n     - +1 if Temp increased this year\n     - +1 if CO\u2082 Stock \u226520\n     - +1 if Global Stress \u226512\n     - +2 if any \u201cAmplifying Feedback\u201d is active  \n   - Then roll **2d6**. If **roll \u2264 Tipping Risk**, draw a **Tipping Point** and resolve it (permanent, usually harsh).  \n   - Reset Tipping Risk down by **2** after a tipping triggers (still dangerous, but prevents chain-triggering that feels arbitrary).\n\n3. Refill Market to 5, discard cubes back to bag, reveal next Event.\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core Mechanics (what players learn by doing)\n\n### Feedback loops (endogenous rule changes)\nFeedback cards don\u2019t just \u201cadd damage\u201d; they change conversions/costs:\n- **Arctic Albedo Loss (Amplifying):** Temperature conversion becomes stronger (needs fewer CO\u2082 to warm).\n- **Sink Saturation:** Natural uptake becomes \u22121 instead of \u22122 per year.\n- **Economic Drag:** If Stress \u226512, every Policy costs +1 Trust to play.\n\n### Uncertainty + tail risk (planning under distribution, not certainty)\n- The cube bag makes extremes rare but real.\n- Innovation can reduce uncertainty *imperfectly*, showing why better forecasting helps but doesn\u2019t eliminate risk.\n\n### Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoff\n- Mitigation reduces **Annual Emissions** (flow) but is often **lagged** and costs Trust.\n- Adaptation improves **Resilience/Wellbeing now**, but warming can outpace it and some events scale with temperature regardless.\n\n### Delayed consequences\n- Infrastructure slots + construction markers force players to plan 1\u20132 years ahead.\n- Early underinvestment shows up later as unavoidable temperature/stress increases.\n\n### Limited competition (non-sabotage scoring)\nTrust is both **currency** and **score**, but you mostly gain it by:\n- playing mitigation that reduces emissions (global credit),\n- preventing your region from collapsing (local legitimacy),\nnot by letting others fail.\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n\n### Immediate collective loss if any occurs\n- Temperature \u2265 **3.0\u00b0C**, or\n- Global Stress \u2265 **20**, or\n- **3 Tipping Points** have triggered, or\n- Any **2 regions** reach Wellbeing 0 simultaneously (systemic humanitarian failure)\n\n### Collective win (after Year 8)\n- Temperature \u2264 **2.0\u00b0C**\n- Global Stress \u2264 **14**\n- Fewer than 3 tipping points\n\n### Personal winner (only if collective win)\nHighest Trust.

If carbon is both \u201ctotal stock\u201d *and* receives large annual additions, temp can spike too quickly, making many games unwinnable (or making mitigation feel pointless). We should **separate \u201cannual emissions\u201d from \u201catmospheric stock\u201d** and add **natural uptake** so mitigation is meaningful.\n- **Ambiguity in event scope:** \u201cGlobal stress\u201d vs regional effects need a clean rule so resolution is fast and fair.\n- **Competitive tension risk:** Trust-as-score is fine, but must not incentivize sabotage. Ensure Trust is earned mainly by **verifiable contribution + local protection**, not by letting others fail.\n- **Complexity budget:** 12+ can handle it, but 35\u201350 minutes requires streamlined phases and limited per-turn choices.\n\nBelow is a revised, play-ready version that keeps the best ideas and patches the risks.\n\n---\n\n# **Game: Lag & Leverage (Revised)**  \n**Players:** 3\u20135 | **Time:** 35\u201350 min | **Ages:** 12+ | **Style:** Cooperative with light \u201ccredit\u201d scoring\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game Objective\n**Collective objective:** Finish **8 Years** without triggering global collapse by keeping:\n- **Warming** under control,\n- **Societal Stress** manageable,\n- and **Tipping Points** limited.\n\n**Personal objective (only if the group survives):** Have the most **Trust** (public/political capital).

Players jointly try to avoid collapse, but individually compete (mildly) for \u201cpublic trust\u201d and \u201cpolitical capital,\u201d creating realistic tension without pay-to-win asymmetry.\n\nContrarian design stance (explicit): the game should *not* reward \u201calways mitigate\u201d or \u201calways adapt.\u201d It should punish simplistic maxing, force tradeoffs, and make players live with the consequences of earlier optimism.\n\n---\n\n# (1) Game Objective\n\nPlayers are leaders of regions cooperating to keep **Global Temperature** and **System Stress** below catastrophic thresholds while maintaining **Human Wellbeing**.\n\n- **Collective goal:** prevent the planet from crossing too many tipping points before the end of the timeline.\n- **Personal goal (secondary):** end with the most **Trust** (represents legitimacy/ability to implement policy). Trust is gained by helping the global effort *and* meeting local needs.\n\n---\n\n# (2) Components List\n\n**Main boards & tracks**\n- 1 **Planet Board** with tracks:\n  - **Temperature (\u00b0C anomaly):** 0.0 to 4.0\n  - **Atmospheric Carbon (CO\u2082 index):** 0\u201330\n  - **System Stress:** 0\u201320 (aggregates disasters, inequality, conflict pressure)\n  - **Tipping Risk Meter:** 0\u201310 (nonlinear)\n  - **Timeline:** 8 rounds (\u201cYears\u201d), each with an event\n- 5 **Region Boards** (use 3\u20135): each has tracks:\n  - **Resilience:** 0\u201310 (adaptation level)\n  - **Emissions Capacity:** shows baseline emissions (varies slightly but balanced)\n  - **Local Wellbeing:** 0\u201310\n  - **Trust:** 0\u201310 (personal score resource)\n\n**Cards**\n- 40 **Policy Cards** (common market; no unique roles). Types:\n  - **Mitigation** (renewables, efficiency, forest protection, carbon pricing, etc.)\n  - **Adaptation** (flood defenses, heat plans, crop R&D, insurance reforms)\n  - **Capacity/Institutional** (grid upgrades, permitting reform, education)\n- 24 **Event Cards** (uncertain shocks; each has ranges)\n- 12 **Feedback Cards** (unlock as thresholds crossed; permanent rules changes)\n- 10 **Tipping Point Cards** (Greenland ice, permafrost methane, Amazon dieback, etc.)\n\n**Tokens**\n- 60 **Carbon Tokens** (added/removed from atmosphere track)\n- 30 **Resilience Tokens**\n- 30 **Stress Tokens**\n- 15 **Innovation Tokens** (reduce future mitigation cost / improve reliability)\n- 1 **Uncertainty Bag** with 20 cubes:\n  - 8 green \u201cLow impact\u201d\n  - 8 yellow \u201cMedium\u201d\n  - 4 red \u201cHigh\u201d (tail risk)\n\n**Dice**\n- 2 six-sided dice (2d6) for some resolution (keeps outcomes probabilistic, not scripted)\n\n---\n\n# (3) Setup\n\n1. Place the **Planet Board**. Set:\n   - Temperature = **1.2\u00b0C**\n   - Atmospheric Carbon = **12**\n   - System Stress = **4**\n   - Tipping Risk = **2**\n2. Choose **3\u20135 Regions**. Each starts:\n   - Resilience = 2\n   - Local Wellbeing = 7\n   - Trust = 5\n   - Baseline emissions: each region has a printed value **(2\u20133)**; totals are similar across region choices (no \u201ceasy mode\u201d region).\n3. Shuffle **Policy Deck**. Deal **5 policy cards** face-up into a common **Policy Market**.\n4. Shuffle **Event Deck** and place by the Timeline. Reveal **Round 1 Event** only (others unknown).\n5. Put **Feedback Cards** in a facedown stack; reveal when triggered.\n6. Put **Tipping Point Cards** facedown.\n7. Put all cubes into the **Uncertainty Bag**.\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn Structure (per Round / Year)\n\nEach of 8 rounds:\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast (Uncertainty is visible, but not knowable)\n- Reveal the current **Event Card** (shows a range like \u201cHeatwave: add 1\u20134 Stress; if Temp \u22652.0 add +2 more\u201d).\n- Draw **2 cubes** from the Uncertainty Bag and place them on the Event card (this *narrows* but doesn\u2019t fully determine severity). Return after resolution.\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning (negotiation + commitments)\n- Players discuss and may make **binding commitments**:\n  - \u201cI will fund X if you do Y\u201d style deals.\n- Each player chooses **2 actions**:\n  - **Take a Policy** from the market (immediately play or hold)\n  - **Implement a Policy** from hand\n  - **Invest**: pay Trust to gain Innovation or Resilience\n  - **Emergency Response**: reduce local Stress at a cost (short-term fix)\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Resolution (delays happen here)\n1. **Emissions & Carbon**\n   - Each region adds its **baseline carbon** to Atmospheric Carbon.\n   - Some mitigation policies reduce current or future emissions.\n2. **Delayed Policy Effects**\n   - Policies have tags:\n     - **Immediate** (acts now)\n     - **Lagged (1\u20132 rounds)** (place a \u201cpending\u201d marker; it resolves later)\n3. **Temperature Update**\n   - For every **5 Carbon** on the track, Temperature rises **+0.2\u00b0C** (rounded down), *but* apply **feedback amplifiers** (see below).\n4. **Event Resolution**\n   - Use the Event\u2019s base severity modified by:\n     - The two Uncertainty cubes (green/yellow/red)\n     - Temperature thresholds\n     - Each region\u2019s Resilience\n   - Add Stress + reduce Wellbeing accordingly.\n5. **Feedback Check**\n   - If thresholds crossed (e.g., Temp \u22651.8, Stress \u226510), reveal a **Feedback Card** that permanently changes rules.\n6. **Tipping Risk Check (nonlinear mechanic)**\n   - Increase Tipping Risk by:\n     - +1 if Temp increased this round\n     - +1 if Carbon \u226520\n     - +1 if Stress \u226512\n     - +2 if any Feedback Card labeled \u201cAmplifying\u201d is active\n   - Then roll **2d6**. If **roll \u2264 Tipping Risk**, draw a **Tipping Point Card** and resolve it (permanent damage).\n7. Refill Policy Market to 5 cards. Reveal next round\u2019s Event.\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core Mechanics (how it teaches through play)\n\n## A. Feedback loops (not just \u201cmore bad things\u201d)\n**Feedback Cards** are permanent rules that *change future conversions*, e.g.:\n- **Arctic Albedo Loss (Amplifying):** Temperature increases convert at **4 Carbon per +0.2\u00b0C** instead of 5.\n- **Drought-Fire Cycle:** When an Event adds Stress, add **+1 extra Stress** unless a region spends 1 Resilience token.\n- **Economic Drag:** If Stress \u226512, players lose **1 Trust** at start of Planning (harder to act).\n\nPlayers feel \u201cthe same action no longer works,\u201d which is the essence of feedback.\n\n## B. Uncertainty with tail risks (you can\u2019t math your way out)\nEvents show ranges; Uncertainty cubes bias outcomes but don\u2019t fully predict them. Red cubes are rare but brutal\u2014mirrors real fat tails.\n\n## C. Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoffs (both can be rational; both can fail)\n- **Mitigation** lowers Carbon/emissions but often:\n  - costs Trust now\n  - has delayed payoff\n- **Adaptation** raises Resilience and protects Wellbeing now but:\n  - doesn\u2019t stop Temperature rise\n  - can create complacency (some Events scale with Temp regardless)\n\nA contrarian balance choice: adaptation is *not* a \u201ctrap,\u201d but it becomes insufficient under high warming and feedback amplification.\n\n## D. Delayed consequences (policy lag & carbon inertia)\nMany strong mitigation cards are **Lagged** (1\u20132 rounds). Players can \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and still lose if they waited too long.\n\n## E. Limited competitive tension (not pay-to-win, but not utopia)\nTrust is both:\n- a **currency** (to implement hard policies, invest, respond)\n- a **score** (tie-break / personal win in collective win)\n\nPlayers are incentivized to help globally while still caring about local optics.\n\n## F. Nonlinear tipping risk (explicit mechanic)\nThe **Tipping Risk Meter + 2d6 check** creates:\n- a slow build that can suddenly \u201cflip\u201d\n- increasing probability as conditions worsen\n- irreversibility via Tipping Point Cards\n\n---\n\n# (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n\n### Collective Loss (any time)\n- Temperature reaches **3.0\u00b0C**, or\n- **3 Tipping Points** have triggered, or\n- System Stress reaches **20** (global instability overwhelms governance)\n\n### Collective Win (end of Round 8)\nIf:\n- Temperature \u2264 **2.0\u00b0C**\n- System Stress \u2264 **14**\n- Fewer than **3 Tipping Points** triggered\n\n### Personal Winner (only if collective win)\nHighest **Trust** wins. If tied: highest Local Wellbeing total.\n\nSelf-critical note: if your group dislikes any competitive layer, ignore personal winner and treat Trust purely as a resource; the learning objectives still work.\n\n---\n\n# (7) Sample Round (Round 4 example)\n\n**Start state**\n- Temp: 1.8\u00b0C, Carbon: 19, Stress: 11, Tipping Risk: 6  \n- Active Feedback: **Arctic Albedo Loss (Amplifying)**\n\n**Phase A \u2014 Forecast**\n- Reveal Event: **\u201cCompound Heat + Grid Strain\u201d**\n  - Base: add **1\u20134 Stress** globally\n  - If Temp \u22651.8: **+2 Stress**\n  - Regions with Resilience \u22655 reduce by 1\n- Draw 2 cubes from bag: **yellow + red** (ominous but not deterministic)\n\n**Phase B \u2014 Planning**\n- Player A implements **Carbon Pricing (Lagged 1)**: pay 2 Trust now, reduce emissions by 2 starting next round.\n- Player B invests in **Resilience** (pay 1 Trust \u2192 +2 Resilience).\n- Player C plays **Grid Modernization (Immediate)**: spend 1 Innovation + 1 Trust \u2192 prevent 2 Stress from \u201cgrid strain\u201d events this round and future.\n- Player D chooses **Emergency Response** to protect Wellbeing: spend 2 Trust \u2192 reduce local Stress by 3.\n\n**Phase C \u2014 Resolution**\n1. Baseline emissions add +10 Carbon total \u2192 Carbon goes from 19 to 29 (yikes).\n2. Delayed effects: Carbon Pricing not active yet.\n3. Temperature update:\n   - Normally: every 5 Carbon gives +0.2\u00b0C; but Albedo Loss makes it **4 Carbon per +0.2\u00b0C**.\n   - With Carbon at 29, the round\u2019s increase is **+0.4\u00b0C** (amplified).\n   - Temp becomes **2.2\u00b0C**.\n4. Event resolution:\n   - Base roll: draw severity using cube modifiers:\n     - yellow = +1, red = +2; plus Temp threshold +2 \u2192 strong hit\n   - Total Stress added = 1d4 (roll 3) +3 (cubes) +2 (temp) = **8**\n   - Grid Modernization prevents 2 \u2192 net **+6 Stress**\n   - Regions apply Resilience reductions if eligible.\n   - System Stress jumps from 11 to **17** (near loss).\n5. Feedback check:\n   - Temp \u22652.0 triggers a new Feedback Card: **Permafrost Thaw (Amplifying):** whenever Temp rises, add +1 Carbon.\n6. Tipping Risk check:\n   - Temp increased: +1\n   - Carbon \u226520: +1\n   - Stress \u226512: +1\n   - Amplifying feedback active: +2\n   - Tipping Risk rises from 6 \u2192 **11** (cap at 10) so effectively **10**\n   - Roll 2d6: **8** \u2264 10 \u2192 tipping happens\n   - Draw Tipping Point: **Amazon Dieback**\n     - Effect: add +3 Carbon immediately and permanently reduce effectiveness of \u201cForest Protection\u201d cards.\n7. Refill market, reveal next event.\n\nLearning outcome: players *feel* that delays + amplification can make a \u201creasonable\u201d round turn into a cascade.\n\n---\n\n# (8) Teacher/Facilitator Debrief Guide (10\u201312 minutes)\n\n### What to do (structure)\n1. **Replay the timeline quickly**: point to when Temperature crossed thresholds, when feedbacks activated, and when tipping risk spiked.\n2. Ask players to identify **one decision they regret** and whether it was due to:\n   - delay misunderstanding\n   - underestimating tails (red cube)\n   - over-investing in local protection vs global mitigation\n3. Connect game terms to real terms:\n   - Carbon tokens \u2192 stock pollutant accumulation\n   - Lagged policies \u2192 infrastructure turnover, political delays\n   - Stress \u2192 compound impacts and social vulnerability\n   - Tipping Risk \u2192 nonlinear Earth system and socio-political instability risks\n\n### Three discussion prompts (use these verbatim)\n\n1. **Feedback loop reasoning:**  \n   \u201cAfter the first Feedback card appeared, what strategy stopped working the way you expected? What did that teach you about systems where rules change as conditions worsen?\u201d\n\n2. **Uncertainty and tails:**  \n   \u201cDid you treat uncertainty as \u2018average outcome\u2019 planning, or did you insure against rare extremes? What would you do differently if red events were rare-but-devastating in real life?\u201d\n\n3. **Mitigation vs adaptation under delay:**  \n   \u201cWhich round shows the clearest tradeoff between spending resources to reduce emissions (slow payoff) vs protecting wellbeing (immediate payoff)? If you could replay, would you shift earlier\u2014and why?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Optional balancing knobs (if playtests show issues)\n- If players lose too often: start Temp at 1.0\u00b0C or give each region +1 Innovation.\n- If mitigation is too strong: increase Trust cost for \u201chard\u201d policies or increase lag.\n- If adaptation dominates: add more event scaling with Temperature regardless of Resilience.\n- If tipping feels too random: cap Tipping Risk growth per round at +3 (still nonlinear, less swingy).\n\nIf you want, I can provide a print-and-play policy card list (40 cards) with exact costs/tags and 12 sample events tuned to hit the 35\u201350 minute window."

Place the main board and set tracks:\n   - W = 1, C = 6, S = 2, Tipping Meter = 0, Round = 1.\n2. Each player chooses a Region board (all identical).\n3. Set each region:\n   - WB = 6, R = 2, E = 3\n   - Place **1 Lock-in token** in a \u201cFossil Infrastructure\u201d box (starts you slightly committed).\n4. Shuffle **Project deck**; each player draws **4 Project cards**, keeps **3**, discards 1 (open discard).\n5. Shuffle **Event deck**; reveal **2 upcoming events** face-up in an \u201cOutlook\u201d area (forecasts uncertainty but not certainty).\n6. Place the **6 Tipping Point tiles** face-up near the board.\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn Structure (Each Round)\n\nEach round represents a decade and has **5 phases**:\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Outlook (Forecast)\n- Reveal the next Event card into the Outlook (so there are always 2 visible upcoming).\n- Some events add **Uncertainty markers** to W, S, or specific regions (\u201crange: +0 to +2 S\u201d).\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning (Simultaneous, then brief negotiation)\n- Each player gets **5 Budget** + **1 Budget per WB above 8** (prosperity helps capacity).\n- Players may trade **1 Budget** once per round (limited cooperation, prevents quarterbacking).\n- Each player selects **up to 2 Projects** to fund this round (cost on card).\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Action (In player order, rotating start player)\nPlayers execute funded projects; effects typically:\n- Change E (emissions), R (resilience), WB (well-being), remove Lock-in, add Carbon removal, etc.\n- Some projects have **Delayed tags**: \u201ceffect starts next round\u201d or \u201cadd 1 Lock-in\u201d (infrastructure inertia).\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Climate Response (System update)\n1. **Emissions to Carbon (with delay)**\n   - Add Carbon tokens equal to **sum of all regions\u2019 E**.\n   - Then remove Carbon equal to **Removal in play** (some projects).\n   - **Delay rule:** If this round\u2019s net added carbon > 0, also add **1 extra Carbon** (represents system inertia/slow sinks). If net \u2264 0, no bonus.\n2. **Carbon to Warming**\n   - For every **3 Carbon above 6**, increase W by 1 (stepwise, not linear).\n3. **Warming to Stress (feedback)**\n   - Increase S by:\n     - +1 if W \u2265 2\n     - +1 more if W \u2265 4\n     - +1 more if W \u2265 5\n   - Then apply any event effects that modify S/W.\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Impacts, Tipping Check, and Recovery\n1. **Impacts (damages)**\n   - Each region takes Damage = **S \u2212 R** (minimum 0).\n   - For each Damage:\n     - Reduce WB by 1 (first), then for every 2 Damage add **1 Lock-in** (crisis rebuild locks in bad choices).\n2. **Tipping Risk (nonlinear mechanic)**\n   - If W \u2265 4, perform a **Tipping Check**:\n     - Roll the **Risk die** and add **Tipping Meter**.\n     - If result \u2265 4: trigger a Tipping Point tile (players choose one not yet triggered).\n       - Apply its permanent effect (often reinforcing feedback).\n       - Increase Tipping Meter by +1 (risk compounds).\n   - Additionally, whenever W increases this round, increase Tipping Meter by +1 (warming accelerates risk).\n3. **Recovery**\n   - Each region may spend up to 2 Budget left-over (if any) to restore WB (+1 per Budget) or remove 1 Damage token (if you use them physically).\n\nAdvance Round marker and rotate first player.\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core Mechanics (What teaches what)\n\n### A. Feedback loops\n- **Reinforcing loop:** Higher W \u2192 higher S \u2192 more Damage \u2192 more Lock-in \u2192 harder to cut E \u2192 more Carbon.\n- **Balancing loop:** Higher WB \u2192 more Budget \u2192 more ability to mitigate/adapt \u2192 less future damage.\n\n### B. Uncertainty (without feeling random/pointless)\n- **Outlook shows 2 upcoming events**: players can plan under partial information.\n- \u201cRange events\u201d place **Uncertainty markers** that convert into a roll in Phase D/E (e.g., \u201cHeatwave: +0 to +2 S\u201d).\n\n### C. Mitigation vs Adaptation tradeoff\n- Mitigation reduces E/C/W but often costs more and/or is delayed.\n- Adaptation increases R and reduces immediate damage but doesn\u2019t stop W rising.\n- Development boosts WB (and thus future capacity) but often increases E and Lock-in.\n\n### D. Delayed consequences\n- Emissions convert to carbon every round, and carbon to warming in **step thresholds** (lags).\n- Some projects are **Delayed** (e.g., grid build-out: -2 E starting next round).\n- Crisis rebuild can add **Lock-in** even as you \u201crecover.\u201d\n\n### E. Nonlinear tipping risk (explicit)\n- Once W \u2265 4, tipping checks begin.\n- Risk increases with W and a compounding **Tipping Meter**; triggered tipping tiles permanently worsen conversion rates or add Stress.\n\n---\n\n# (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n\n### Collective Loss (everyone loses immediately) if any occurs:\n- W reaches 6 (runaway warming scenario)\n- S reaches 10 (systemic global disruption)\n- 3 Tipping Points have triggered (cascading threshold failure)\n- Any **two** regions drop to WB = 0 (global instability spillovers)\n\n### Collective Win (team succeeds) if at end of Round 8:\n- W \u2264 4\n- S \u2264 7\n- Tipping Points triggered \u2264 1\n- All regions have WB \u2265 4\n\n### \u201cLimited competitive tension\u201d scoring (only if team wins):\nEach player calculates a **Regional Score**:\n- +WB (final)\n- +R (final)\n- \u2212Lock-in\n- \u2212(E final)\n\nHighest score is \u201cMost Sustainable Transition.\u201d  \nIf the team loses, no one scores (prevents selfish play).\n\n**Risk-management note:** This structure discourages free-riding but still allows different strategic identities (mitigation leader, adaptation specialist, development-first then pivot).\n\n---\n\n# (7) Sample Round (4 players)\n\n**Start state:** W=3, C=9, S=5, Tipping Meter=1.  \nRegions A\u2013D have E totals: A=3, B=2, C=4, D=3 (sum E=12).

Did the two-card Outlook change your behavior compared to pure randomness?\u201d\n   - Follow-up: \u201cWhat\u2019s an example where you hedged (robust strategy) versus optimized (risky strategy)?\u201d\n\n3. **Mitigation vs adaptation under delay**\n   - \u201cWhen did adaptation feel essential, and when did it feel like it was just \u2018buying time\u2019?\u201d\n   - Follow-up: \u201cAt what point did mitigation become too late or too expensive, and why?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical/risk-management note (for the facilitator)\n- **Risk:** Players may conclude \u201cadaptation is enough\u201d if they get a low-event run.  \n  **Mitigation:** In debrief, compare outcomes: Did W or tipping risk keep rising even with strong R?\n- **Risk:** Strong players may dominate planning.  \n  **Mitigation:** Enforce the \u201cone trade per round\u201d and simultaneous planning; consider using a 2-minute sand timer.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also provide: printable card templates (10\u201312 example Project cards and 10 Event cards), or a \u201csimplified\u201d 6-round version for 35 minutes consistently."

That risks teaching \u201cwe\u2019re doomed no matter what,\u201d which is both bad pedagogy and bad game feel.\n2. **Stress and damage may cascade too deterministically.** If S rises almost every round by fixed thresholds, adaptation becomes mandatory and repetitive rather than a strategic choice.\n3. **Tipping choice by players is thematically odd.** In reality you don\u2019t \u201cpick\u201d which tipping point happens. Players can influence *risk*, not select the outcome. Let the system select randomly (with some conditioning), while still letting players manage exposure.\n4. **\u201cInertia bonus carbon if net > 0\u201d** is a bit arbitrary. Better to model *lag* as a separate \u201cHeat in the Pipeline\u201d track or queued emissions.\n5. **Competitive tension is okay but could be cleaner.** A single shared \u201cGlobal Budget\u201d or \u201cPolitical Will\u201d pool can create real negotiation tradeoffs without asymmetric roles.\n\nBelow is a revised, tighter design that preserves the best ideas but fixes the runaway pacing, makes tipping feel more realistic, and ensures multiple viable strategies.\n\n---\n\n# Game: **Thresholds: Feedback**\n\n**Ages:** 12+  \n**Players:** 3\u20135 (no asymmetric roles; all regions identical)  \n**Time:** 35\u201350 minutes  \n**Style:** Semi-cooperative systems strategy (cooperative survival + light competitive sustainability scoring)\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game objective\nOver **7 rounds** (each = ~10 years), players govern regions in a shared climate system.

Set global tracks:\n   - **C = 8**, **W = 1**, **S = 2**, **H = 2**, **TR = 0**, Round = 1.\n2. Each player takes an identical Region board and sets:\n   - **WB = 6**, **R = 2**, **E = 3**, **L = 2**.\n3. Shuffle **Project** deck; each player draws **5**, keeps **3**, discards 2 face-up (creates early meta-information; reduces analysis paralysis later).\n4. Shuffle **Event** deck; reveal **2 events** into an **Outlook** row (face-up).\n5. Place **6 tipping tiles** face-up. Put them in a fixed order of reveal (A\u2013F) *or* shuffle into a facedown stack (recommended).\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn structure (each round)\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Outlook (Forecast)\n- Reveal 1 new Event into Outlook so there are always **2 face-up upcoming**.\n- If an Event shows a **? icon**, place a **? marker** on W, S, or a specific region as instructed (it will resolve later).\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Budget & Negotiation (2\u20133 minutes)\n- Each player gains **5 Budget**.\n- Plus **+1 Budget if WB \u2265 9** (prosperity increases capacity).\n- Players may make **one deal each**: trade Budget *or* commit to a joint project (\u201cI\u2019ll pay 2 if you play coastal defenses\u201d).\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Plan (simultaneous)\nEach player chooses **up to 2 Projects** to fund and (if ongoing) slot into Policy slots. Unfunded cards stay in hand.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Act (in turn order)\nExecute funded projects:\n- Adjust E, R, WB, L, remove damage, add ongoing effects, etc.\n- Some projects add **Commitment**: \u201cPlace 1 token on H\u201d (e.g., slow-to-deploy infrastructure) or \u201cRemove 1 from L\u201d (de-locking reform).\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Climate response (system update)\nThis is where delay + feedback live.\n\n1. **Emissions \u2192 Carbon (C)**\n   - Increase C by: **ceil( (\u03a3E + \u03a3L) / number of players )**\n   - Then subtract **Removal** from active mitigation projects (usually 0\u20132).\n   - Why this works: Lock-in raises effective emissions; averaging prevents 5-player games from auto-dooming.\n\n2. **Carbon \u2192 Heat in Pipeline (H)**\n   - If **C \u2265 12**, add **+1 H**.\n   - If **C \u2265 16**, add **another +1 H** (nonlinear).\n\n3. **Heat in Pipeline \u2192 Warming (W) (delay)**\n   - Convert **2 H into +1 W**, then reduce H by 2 (minimum 0).\n   - This models committed warming that arrives later even if emissions fall.\n\n4. **Warming \u2192 Stress (S) (with threshold jumps)**\n   - Increase S by:\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 2**\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 4**\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 5**\n   - Then resolve any Event effects on S/W (including ? markers).\n\n### Phase F \u2014 Impacts, tipping, and recovery\n1. **Impacts (regional)**\n   - Each region takes **Damage = max(0, S \u2212 R)**.\n   - For every **2 Damage**, choose one:\n     - **WB \u22121** (social/health costs), or\n     - **L +1** (rebuilding lock-in), or\n     - **E +1** (emergency fossil fallback)\n   - This choice is a key teaching moment: damage creates *policy traps*.\n\n2. **Tipping check (nonlinear tipping risk mechanic)**\n   - If **W \u2265 4**, do a tipping check:\n     - Roll Risk die + TR.\n     - If result **\u2265 4**, trigger the **top tipping tile** (or random tile).\n   - **TR increases** by:\n     - **+1 whenever W increases**, and\n     - **+1 if C \u2265 16** (high carbon raises background risk).\n   - Triggered tipping tiles add permanent effects (examples):\n     - *Ice Albedo:* whenever W \u2265 4, S gets +1 each round.\n     - *Permafrost:* C increases +1 each round (reinforcing loop).\n     - *Forest Dieback:* removal effects are \u22121 weaker (sink degradation).\n\n3. **Recovery**\n   - Each player may spend up to **2 Budget** to:\n     - remove 1 Damage, or\n     - +1 WB, or\n     - reduce L by 1 (costly reform).\n\nAdvance Round, rotate first player.\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core mechanics (what teaches what)\n\n- **Feedback loops**\n  - Reinforcing: Damage \u2192 Lock-in/E fallback \u2192 higher C \u2192 higher W \u2192 higher S \u2192 more Damage.\n  - Balancing: Higher WB \u2192 more Budget \u2192 more mitigation/adaptation \u2192 lower future damages.\n- **Uncertainty**\n  - Two-card forecast encourages planning, but \u201c?\u201d markers turn into a roll later (uncertainty is time-shifted, not absent).\n- **Mitigation vs adaptation**\n  - Adaptation raises R and reduces Damage now.\n  - Mitigation reduces E/C/H, but H can still \u201ccash out\u201d into W later.\n- **Delayed consequences**\n  - H track explicitly stores \u201cwarming owed,\u201d so players feel the lag.\n- **Nonlinear tipping risk**\n  - Tipping only starts at W\u22654, then accelerates with TR and carbon thresholds.\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/loss conditions\n\n### Immediate collective loss if any occurs\n- **W = 6**, or\n- **S = 10**, or\n- **3 tipping tiles triggered**, or\n- Any **one region** reaches **WB = 0** (political/system collapse spillover).\n\n### Collective win (end of Round 7) if all true\n- **W \u2264 4**\n- **S \u2264 7**\n- **Tipping triggered \u2264 1**\n- Every region has **WB \u2265 4**\n\n### Light competitive scoring (only if the table wins)\nEach player score:\n- +WB (final)\n- +R (final)\n- \u2212L (final)\n- \u2212E (final)\nHighest is \u201cBest Transition,\u201d but only after collective survival.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample round (4 players)\n\n**Start of Round 4:** C=13, W=3, H=3, S=4, TR=1  \nRegions (A\u2013D): E = 3/2/4/3, L = 2/3/2/2, R varies.\n\n**Outlook:**  \n- Event 1 (this round): \u201cHeatwave uncertainty: place ? on S (adds +0 to +2 later).\u201d  \n- Event 2 (next): \u201cSupply crunch: first mitigation project costs +1.\u201d\n\n**Budget:** each gets 5 (no one at WB\u22659).\n\n**Projects chosen:**\n- A: Efficiency retrofit (E\u22121 now), Clinics (WB+1, R+1 delayed)\n- B: Coastal defenses (R+2), Fossil subsidy rollback (L\u22121, WB\u22121 now)\n- C: Industrial expansion (WB+2, E+1, L+1)\n- D: Renewables buildout (Delayed: E\u22122 next round; L+1 now)\n\n**Climate response:**\n1) \u03a3E= (2+2+5+3)=12; \u03a3L=(2+2+3+3)=10  \nAdd to C: ceil((12+10)/4)=ceil(22/4)=6 \u2192 C becomes 19 (minus any removal; assume 1) \u2192 C=18  \n2) C\u226512 \u2192 H+1; C\u226516 \u2192 H+1 (H was 3 \u2192 now 5)  \n3) Convert H: 2H \u2192 +1W, H\u22122. H=5 gives W+2? No: convert once per round: **2H \u2192 +1W** (keeps pacing sane). So W becomes 4, H becomes 3.  \n4) W=4 adds +1 (W\u22652) and +1 (W\u22654): S +2 (S goes 4\u21926)  \nResolve \u201c?\u201d on S: roll risk die =2 \u2192 S becomes 8.\n\n**Impacts:**\nDamage = S \u2212 R. Players with low R get hammered; each 2 Damage forces a hard choice (WB hit vs lock-in vs emissions fallback).\n\n**Tipping check (W\u22654):**\nRoll risk die (say 1) + TR(1) = 2 \u2192 no tipping.  \nBut TR increases because W increased: TR becomes 2.\n\nPlayers experience: even if they cut E now, **H still pushes W up**, and **the moment W hits 4 the game\u2019s character changes** (stress jumps + tipping becomes a real threat).\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide (10 minutes)\n\n### What to surface explicitly\n- Players were doing \u201cpolicy under constraints,\u201d not solving a puzzle.\n- The game is biased toward **systems thinking**: actions are less important than *loops, delays, thresholds,* and *robust decisions under uncertainty.*\n\n### Three discussion prompts\n1. **Delay & committed change**\n   - \u201cDid you ever reduce emissions but still see warming rise? What did the Heat-in-the-Pipeline track represent in real life?\u201d\n2. **Tradeoffs: mitigation vs adaptation**\n   - \u201cWhich felt more urgent in play\u2014reducing E/C or raising R/WB? When did adaptation feel like relief, and when did it feel like postponing the problem?\u201d\n3. **Tipping and nonlinear risk**\n   - \u201cWhat changed in your decision-making once W hit 4 and tipping checks began? Did you switch strategies (hedging, cooperation, \u2018panic mitigation\u2019), and why?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical facilitation notes (to avoid wrong takeaways)\n- If students conclude \u201crandomness decides everything,\u201d point out: **uncertainty changed outcomes, but choices changed the odds and the system state** (TR, H, R).\n- If students conclude \u201cdevelopment is always bad,\u201d highlight that **WB increases capacity** (budgets) and can enable later mitigation\u2014*but* lock-in can erase that benefit.\n\n--- \n\nIf you want printable support, I can provide **12 example Project cards + 10 Event cards + 6 tipping tile texts** tuned to keep typical games inside the 35\u201350 minute window without inevitable collapse."

If carbon is both \u201ctotal stock\u201d *and* receives large annual additions, temp can spike too quickly, making many games unwinnable (or making mitigation feel pointless). We should **separate \u201cannual emissions\u201d from \u201catmospheric stock\u201d** and add **natural uptake** so mitigation is meaningful.\n- **Ambiguity in event scope:** \u201cGlobal stress\u201d vs regional effects need a clean rule so resolution is fast and fair.\n- **Competitive tension risk:** Trust-as-score is fine, but must not incentivize sabotage. Ensure Trust is earned mainly by **verifiable contribution + local protection**, not by letting others fail.\n- **Complexity budget:** 12+ can handle it, but 35\u201350 minutes requires streamlined phases and limited per-turn choices.\n\nBelow is a revised, play-ready version that keeps the best ideas and patches the risks.\n\n---\n\n# **Game: Lag & Leverage (Revised)**  \n**Players:** 3\u20135 | **Time:** 35\u201350 min | **Ages:** 12+ | **Style:** Cooperative with light \u201ccredit\u201d scoring\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game Objective\n**Collective objective:** Finish **8 Years** without triggering global collapse by keeping:\n- **Warming** under control,\n- **Societal Stress** manageable,\n- and **Tipping Points** limited.\n\n**Personal objective (only if the group survives):** Have the most **Trust** (public/political capital).

Types:\n  - **Mitigation** (renewables, efficiency, forest protection, carbon pricing, etc.)\n  - **Adaptation** (flood defenses, heat plans, crop R&D, insurance reforms)\n  - **Capacity/Institutional** (grid upgrades, permitting reform, education)\n- 24 **Event Cards** (uncertain shocks; each has ranges)\n- 12 **Feedback Cards** (unlock as thresholds crossed; permanent rules changes)\n- 10 **Tipping Point Cards** (Greenland ice, permafrost methane, Amazon dieback, etc.)\n\n**Tokens**\n- 60 **Carbon Tokens** (added/removed from atmosphere track)\n- 30 **Resilience Tokens**\n- 30 **Stress Tokens**\n- 15 **Innovation Tokens** (reduce future mitigation cost / improve reliability)\n- 1 **Uncertainty Bag** with 20 cubes:\n  - 8 green \u201cLow impact\u201d\n  - 8 yellow \u201cMedium\u201d\n  - 4 red \u201cHigh\u201d (tail risk)\n\n**Dice**\n- 2 six-sided dice (2d6) for some resolution (keeps outcomes probabilistic, not scripted)\n\n---\n\n# (3) Setup\n\n1. Place the **Planet Board**. Set:\n   - Temperature = **1.2\u00b0C**\n   - Atmospheric Carbon = **12**\n   - System Stress = **4**\n   - Tipping Risk = **2**\n2. Choose **3\u20135 Regions**. Each starts:\n   - Resilience = 2\n   - Local Wellbeing = 7\n   - Trust = 5\n   - Baseline emissions: each region has a printed value **(2\u20133)**; totals are similar across region choices (no \u201ceasy mode\u201d region).\n3. Shuffle **Policy Deck**. Deal **5 policy cards** face-up into a common **Policy Market**.\n4. Shuffle **Event Deck** and place by the Timeline. Reveal **Round 1 Event** only (others unknown).\n5. Put **Feedback Cards** in a facedown stack; reveal when triggered.\n6. Put **Tipping Point Cards** facedown.\n7. Put all cubes into the **Uncertainty Bag**.\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn Structure (per Round / Year)\n\nEach of 8 rounds:\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Forecast (Uncertainty is visible, but not knowable)\n- Reveal the current **Event Card** (shows a range like \u201cHeatwave: add 1\u20134 Stress; if Temp \u22652.0 add +2 more\u201d).\n- Draw **2 cubes** from the Uncertainty Bag and place them on the Event card (this *narrows* but doesn\u2019t fully determine severity). Return after resolution.\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning (negotiation + commitments)\n- Players discuss and may make **binding commitments**:\n  - \u201cI will fund X if you do Y\u201d style deals.\n- Each player chooses **2 actions**:\n  - **Take a Policy** from the market (immediately play or hold)\n  - **Implement a Policy** from hand\n  - **Invest**: pay Trust to gain Innovation or Resilience\n  - **Emergency Response**: reduce local Stress at a cost (short-term fix)\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Resolution (delays happen here)\n1. **Emissions & Carbon**\n   - Each region adds its **baseline carbon** to Atmospheric Carbon.\n   - Some mitigation policies reduce current or future emissions.\n2. **Delayed Policy Effects**\n   - Policies have tags:\n     - **Immediate** (acts now)\n     - **Lagged (1\u20132 rounds)** (place a \u201cpending\u201d marker; it resolves later)\n3. **Temperature Update**\n   - For every **5 Carbon** on the track, Temperature rises **+0.2\u00b0C** (rounded down), *but* apply **feedback amplifiers** (see below).\n4. **Event Resolution**\n   - Use the Event\u2019s base severity modified by:\n     - The two Uncertainty cubes (green/yellow/red)\n     - Temperature thresholds\n     - Each region\u2019s Resilience\n   - Add Stress + reduce Wellbeing accordingly.\n5. **Feedback Check**\n   - If thresholds crossed (e.g., Temp \u22651.8, Stress \u226510), reveal a **Feedback Card** that permanently changes rules.\n6. **Tipping Risk Check (nonlinear mechanic)**\n   - Increase Tipping Risk by:\n     - +1 if Temp increased this round\n     - +1 if Carbon \u226520\n     - +1 if Stress \u226512\n     - +2 if any Feedback Card labeled \u201cAmplifying\u201d is active\n   - Then roll **2d6**. If **roll \u2264 Tipping Risk**, draw a **Tipping Point Card** and resolve it (permanent damage).\n7. Refill Policy Market to 5 cards. Reveal next round\u2019s Event.\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core Mechanics (how it teaches through play)\n\n## A. Feedback loops (not just \u201cmore bad things\u201d)\n**Feedback Cards** are permanent rules that *change future conversions*, e.g.:\n- **Arctic Albedo Loss (Amplifying):** Temperature increases convert at **4 Carbon per +0.2\u00b0C** instead of 5.\n- **Drought-Fire Cycle:** When an Event adds Stress, add **+1 extra Stress** unless a region spends 1 Resilience token.\n- **Economic Drag:** If Stress \u226512, players lose **1 Trust** at start of Planning (harder to act).\n\nPlayers feel \u201cthe same action no longer works,\u201d which is the essence of feedback.\n\n## B. Uncertainty with tail risks (you can\u2019t math your way out)\nEvents show ranges; Uncertainty cubes bias outcomes but don\u2019t fully predict them. Red cubes are rare but brutal\u2014mirrors real fat tails.\n\n## C. Mitigation vs adaptation tradeoffs (both can be rational; both can fail)\n- **Mitigation** lowers Carbon/emissions but often:\n  - costs Trust now\n  - has delayed payoff\n- **Adaptation** raises Resilience and protects Wellbeing now but:\n  - doesn\u2019t stop Temperature rise\n  - can create complacency (some Events scale with Temp regardless)\n\nA contrarian balance choice: adaptation is *not* a \u201ctrap,\u201d but it becomes insufficient under high warming and feedback amplification.\n\n## D. Delayed consequences (policy lag & carbon inertia)\nMany strong mitigation cards are **Lagged** (1\u20132 rounds). Players can \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and still lose if they waited too long.\n\n## E. Limited competitive tension (not pay-to-win, but not utopia)\nTrust is both:\n- a **currency** (to implement hard policies, invest, respond)\n- a **score** (tie-break / personal win in collective win)\n\nPlayers are incentivized to help globally while still caring about local optics.\n\n## F. Nonlinear tipping risk (explicit mechanic)\nThe **Tipping Risk Meter + 2d6 check** creates:\n- a slow build that can suddenly \u201cflip\u201d\n- increasing probability as conditions worsen\n- irreversibility via Tipping Point Cards\n\n---\n\n# (6) Win/Loss Conditions\n\n### Collective Loss (any time)\n- Temperature reaches **3.0\u00b0C**, or\n- **3 Tipping Points** have triggered, or\n- System Stress reaches **20** (global instability overwhelms governance)\n\n### Collective Win (end of Round 8)\nIf:\n- Temperature \u2264 **2.0\u00b0C**\n- System Stress \u2264 **14**\n- Fewer than **3 Tipping Points** triggered\n\n### Personal Winner (only if collective win)\nHighest **Trust** wins. If tied: highest Local Wellbeing total.\n\nSelf-critical note: if your group dislikes any competitive layer, ignore personal winner and treat Trust purely as a resource; the learning objectives still work.\n\n---\n\n# (7) Sample Round (Round 4 example)\n\n**Start state**\n- Temp: 1.8\u00b0C, Carbon: 19, Stress: 11, Tipping Risk: 6  \n- Active Feedback: **Arctic Albedo Loss (Amplifying)**\n\n**Phase A \u2014 Forecast**\n- Reveal Event: **\u201cCompound Heat + Grid Strain\u201d**\n  - Base: add **1\u20134 Stress** globally\n  - If Temp \u22651.8: **+2 Stress**\n  - Regions with Resilience \u22655 reduce by 1\n- Draw 2 cubes from bag: **yellow + red** (ominous but not deterministic)\n\n**Phase B \u2014 Planning**\n- Player A implements **Carbon Pricing (Lagged 1)**: pay 2 Trust now, reduce emissions by 2 starting next round.\n- Player B invests in **Resilience** (pay 1 Trust \u2192 +2 Resilience).\n- Player C plays **Grid Modernization (Immediate)**: spend 1 Innovation + 1 Trust \u2192 prevent 2 Stress from \u201cgrid strain\u201d events this round and future.\n- Player D chooses **Emergency Response** to protect Wellbeing: spend 2 Trust \u2192 reduce local Stress by 3.\n\n**Phase C \u2014 Resolution**\n1. Baseline emissions add +10 Carbon total \u2192 Carbon goes from 19 to 29 (yikes).\n2. Delayed effects: Carbon Pricing not active yet.\n3. Temperature update:\n   - Normally: every 5 Carbon gives +0.2\u00b0C; but Albedo Loss makes it **4 Carbon per +0.2\u00b0C**.\n   - With Carbon at 29, the round\u2019s increase is **+0.4\u00b0C** (amplified).\n   - Temp becomes **2.2\u00b0C**.\n4. Event resolution:\n   - Base roll: draw severity using cube modifiers:\n     - yellow = +1, red = +2; plus Temp threshold +2 \u2192 strong hit\n   - Total Stress added = 1d4 (roll 3) +3 (cubes) +2 (temp) = **8**\n   - Grid Modernization prevents 2 \u2192 net **+6 Stress**\n   - Regions apply Resilience reductions if eligible.\n   - System Stress jumps from 11 to **17** (near loss).\n5. Feedback check:\n   - Temp \u22652.0 triggers a new Feedback Card: **Permafrost Thaw (Amplifying):** whenever Temp rises, add +1 Carbon.\n6. Tipping Risk check:\n   - Temp increased: +1\n   - Carbon \u226520: +1\n   - Stress \u226512: +1\n   - Amplifying feedback active: +2\n   - Tipping Risk rises from 6 \u2192 **11** (cap at 10) so effectively **10**\n   - Roll 2d6: **8** \u2264 10 \u2192 tipping happens\n   - Draw Tipping Point: **Amazon Dieback**\n     - Effect: add +3 Carbon immediately and permanently reduce effectiveness of \u201cForest Protection\u201d cards.\n7. Refill market, reveal next event.\n\nLearning outcome: players *feel* that delays + amplification can make a \u201creasonable\u201d round turn into a cascade.\n\n---\n\n# (8) Teacher/Facilitator Debrief Guide (10\u201312 minutes)\n\n### What to do (structure)\n1. **Replay the timeline quickly**: point to when Temperature crossed thresholds, when feedbacks activated, and when tipping risk spiked.\n2. Ask players to identify **one decision they regret** and whether it was due to:\n   - delay misunderstanding\n   - underestimating tails (red cube)\n   - over-investing in local protection vs global mitigation\n3. Connect game terms to real terms:\n   - Carbon tokens \u2192 stock pollutant accumulation\n   - Lagged policies \u2192 infrastructure turnover, political delays\n   - Stress \u2192 compound impacts and social vulnerability\n   - Tipping Risk \u2192 nonlinear Earth system and socio-political instability risks\n\n### Three discussion prompts (use these verbatim)\n\n1. **Feedback loop reasoning:**  \n   \u201cAfter the first Feedback card appeared, what strategy stopped working the way you expected? What did that teach you about systems where rules change as conditions worsen?\u201d\n\n2. **Uncertainty and tails:**  \n   \u201cDid you treat uncertainty as \u2018average outcome\u2019 planning, or did you insure against rare extremes? What would you do differently if red events were rare-but-devastating in real life?\u201d\n\n3. **Mitigation vs adaptation under delay:**  \n   \u201cWhich round shows the clearest tradeoff between spending resources to reduce emissions (slow payoff) vs protecting wellbeing (immediate payoff)? If you could replay, would you shift earlier\u2014and why?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Optional balancing knobs (if playtests show issues)\n- If players lose too often: start Temp at 1.0\u00b0C or give each region +1 Innovation.\n- If mitigation is too strong: increase Trust cost for \u201chard\u201d policies or increase lag.\n- If adaptation dominates: add more event scaling with Temperature regardless of Resilience.\n- If tipping feels too random: cap Tipping Risk growth per round at +3 (still nonlinear, less swingy).\n\nIf you want, I can provide a print-and-play policy card list (40 cards) with exact costs/tags and 12 sample events tuned to hit the 35\u201350 minute window."

Place the main board and set tracks:\n   - W = 1, C = 6, S = 2, Tipping Meter = 0, Round = 1.\n2. Each player chooses a Region board (all identical).\n3. Set each region:\n   - WB = 6, R = 2, E = 3\n   - Place **1 Lock-in token** in a \u201cFossil Infrastructure\u201d box (starts you slightly committed).\n4. Shuffle **Project deck**; each player draws **4 Project cards**, keeps **3**, discards 1 (open discard).\n5. Shuffle **Event deck**; reveal **2 upcoming events** face-up in an \u201cOutlook\u201d area (forecasts uncertainty but not certainty).\n6. Place the **6 Tipping Point tiles** face-up near the board.\n\n---\n\n# (4) Turn Structure (Each Round)\n\nEach round represents a decade and has **5 phases**:\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Outlook (Forecast)\n- Reveal the next Event card into the Outlook (so there are always 2 visible upcoming).\n- Some events add **Uncertainty markers** to W, S, or specific regions (\u201crange: +0 to +2 S\u201d).\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Planning (Simultaneous, then brief negotiation)\n- Each player gets **5 Budget** + **1 Budget per WB above 8** (prosperity helps capacity).\n- Players may trade **1 Budget** once per round (limited cooperation, prevents quarterbacking).\n- Each player selects **up to 2 Projects** to fund this round (cost on card).\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Action (In player order, rotating start player)\nPlayers execute funded projects; effects typically:\n- Change E (emissions), R (resilience), WB (well-being), remove Lock-in, add Carbon removal, etc.\n- Some projects have **Delayed tags**: \u201ceffect starts next round\u201d or \u201cadd 1 Lock-in\u201d (infrastructure inertia).\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Climate Response (System update)\n1. **Emissions to Carbon (with delay)**\n   - Add Carbon tokens equal to **sum of all regions\u2019 E**.\n   - Then remove Carbon equal to **Removal in play** (some projects).\n   - **Delay rule:** If this round\u2019s net added carbon > 0, also add **1 extra Carbon** (represents system inertia/slow sinks). If net \u2264 0, no bonus.\n2. **Carbon to Warming**\n   - For every **3 Carbon above 6**, increase W by 1 (stepwise, not linear).\n3. **Warming to Stress (feedback)**\n   - Increase S by:\n     - +1 if W \u2265 2\n     - +1 more if W \u2265 4\n     - +1 more if W \u2265 5\n   - Then apply any event effects that modify S/W.\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Impacts, Tipping Check, and Recovery\n1. **Impacts (damages)**\n   - Each region takes Damage = **S \u2212 R** (minimum 0).\n   - For each Damage:\n     - Reduce WB by 1 (first), then for every 2 Damage add **1 Lock-in** (crisis rebuild locks in bad choices).\n2. **Tipping Risk (nonlinear mechanic)**\n   - If W \u2265 4, perform a **Tipping Check**:\n     - Roll the **Risk die** and add **Tipping Meter**.\n     - If result \u2265 4: trigger a Tipping Point tile (players choose one not yet triggered).\n       - Apply its permanent effect (often reinforcing feedback).\n       - Increase Tipping Meter by +1 (risk compounds).\n   - Additionally, whenever W increases this round, increase Tipping Meter by +1 (warming accelerates risk).\n3. **Recovery**\n   - Each region may spend up to 2 Budget left-over (if any) to restore WB (+1 per Budget) or remove 1 Damage token (if you use them physically).\n\nAdvance Round marker and rotate first player.\n\n---\n\n# (5) Core Mechanics (What teaches what)\n\n### A. Feedback loops\n- **Reinforcing loop:** Higher W \u2192 higher S \u2192 more Damage \u2192 more Lock-in \u2192 harder to cut E \u2192 more Carbon.\n- **Balancing loop:** Higher WB \u2192 more Budget \u2192 more ability to mitigate/adapt \u2192 less future damage.\n\n### B. Uncertainty (without feeling random/pointless)\n- **Outlook shows 2 upcoming events**: players can plan under partial information.\n- \u201cRange events\u201d place **Uncertainty markers** that convert into a roll in Phase D/E (e.g., \u201cHeatwave: +0 to +2 S\u201d).\n\n### C. Mitigation vs Adaptation tradeoff\n- Mitigation reduces E/C/W but often costs more and/or is delayed.\n- Adaptation increases R and reduces immediate damage but doesn\u2019t stop W rising.\n- Development boosts WB (and thus future capacity) but often increases E and Lock-in.\n\n### D. Delayed consequences\n- Emissions convert to carbon every round, and carbon to warming in **step thresholds** (lags).\n- Some projects are **Delayed** (e.g., grid build-out: -2 E starting next round).\n- Crisis rebuild can add **Lock-in** even as you \u201crecover.\u201d\n\n### E.

That risks teaching \u201cwe\u2019re doomed no matter what,\u201d which is both bad pedagogy and bad game feel.\n2. **Stress and damage may cascade too deterministically.** If S rises almost every round by fixed thresholds, adaptation becomes mandatory and repetitive rather than a strategic choice.\n3. **Tipping choice by players is thematically odd.** In reality you don\u2019t \u201cpick\u201d which tipping point happens. Players can influence *risk*, not select the outcome. Let the system select randomly (with some conditioning), while still letting players manage exposure.\n4. **\u201cInertia bonus carbon if net > 0\u201d** is a bit arbitrary. Better to model *lag* as a separate \u201cHeat in the Pipeline\u201d track or queued emissions.\n5. **Competitive tension is okay but could be cleaner.** A single shared \u201cGlobal Budget\u201d or \u201cPolitical Will\u201d pool can create real negotiation tradeoffs without asymmetric roles.\n\nBelow is a revised, tighter design that preserves the best ideas but fixes the runaway pacing, makes tipping feel more realistic, and ensures multiple viable strategies.\n\n---\n\n# Game: **Thresholds: Feedback**\n\n**Ages:** 12+  \n**Players:** 3\u20135 (no asymmetric roles; all regions identical)  \n**Time:** 35\u201350 minutes  \n**Style:** Semi-cooperative systems strategy (cooperative survival + light competitive sustainability scoring)\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game objective\nOver **7 rounds** (each = ~10 years), players govern regions in a shared climate system. The table must:\n- Keep **Warming** and **Stress** below collapse levels,\n- Avoid **cascading tipping points**,\n- Maintain minimum **human well-being** in every region.\n\nPlayers must reason about:\n- **Feedback loops** (lock-in, albedo/methane, resilience)\n- **Uncertainty** (forecast + probabilistic impacts)\n- **Mitigation vs. adaptation** (short-term protection vs. long-term risk)\n- **Delayed consequences** (emissions commitments, warming lag)\n- **Nonlinear tipping** (risk accelerates after thresholds)\n\n---\n\n## (2) Components list\n\n### Boards & tracks\n- **Main board** with tracks:\n  - **Atmospheric Carbon (C):** 0\u201320\n  - **Warming (W):** 0\u20136\n  - **System Stress (S):** 0\u201310\n  - **Heat in the Pipeline (H):** 0\u20136 (delayed warming)\n  - **Tipping Risk (TR):** 0\u20136 (risk multiplier)\n  - **Round:** 1\u20137\n- **3\u20135 identical Region boards**, each with:\n  - **Well-Being (WB):** 0\u201312\n  - **Resilience (R):** 0\u20138\n  - **Emissions (E):** 0\u20136\n  - **Lock-in (L):** 0\u20136 (infrastructure/political inertia)\n  - **3 Policy slots** (ongoing projects)\n\n### Cards\n- **Project deck (70 cards)** shared by all:\n  - Mitigation, Adaptation, Development, Mixed\n  - Some are **Delayed**, some create/remove **Lock-in**\n- **Event deck (45 cards)**:\n  - Climate variability + economic/policy shocks\n  - Many include **Forecast icons** and **uncertainty ranges**\n\n### Tokens & dice\n- Budget tokens (\u201cCapacity\u201d): ~90\n- Damage tokens: ~60\n- Carbon tokens: ~40 (or use track only)\n- **Uncertainty markers (\u201c?\u201d):** ~20\n- **Tipping tiles (6):** Ice Albedo, Permafrost Methane, Forest Dieback, Monsoon Shift, AMOC Slowdown, Coral Collapse\n- **Risk die (custom d6):** 0,0,1,1,2,3\n\n---\n\n## (3) Setup\n1. Set global tracks:\n   - **C = 8**, **W = 1**, **S = 2**, **H = 2**, **TR = 0**, Round = 1.\n2. Each player takes an identical Region board and sets:\n   - **WB = 6**, **R = 2**, **E = 3**, **L = 2**.\n3. Shuffle **Project** deck; each player draws **5**, keeps **3**, discards 2 face-up (creates early meta-information; reduces analysis paralysis later).\n4. Shuffle **Event** deck; reveal **2 events** into an **Outlook** row (face-up).\n5. Place **6 tipping tiles** face-up. Put them in a fixed order of reveal (A\u2013F) *or* shuffle into a facedown stack (recommended).\n\n---\n\n## (4) Turn structure (each round)\n\n### Phase A \u2014 Outlook (Forecast)\n- Reveal 1 new Event into Outlook so there are always **2 face-up upcoming**.\n- If an Event shows a **? icon**, place a **? marker** on W, S, or a specific region as instructed (it will resolve later).\n\n### Phase B \u2014 Budget & Negotiation (2\u20133 minutes)\n- Each player gains **5 Budget**.\n- Plus **+1 Budget if WB \u2265 9** (prosperity increases capacity).\n- Players may make **one deal each**: trade Budget *or* commit to a joint project (\u201cI\u2019ll pay 2 if you play coastal defenses\u201d).\n\n### Phase C \u2014 Plan (simultaneous)\nEach player chooses **up to 2 Projects** to fund and (if ongoing) slot into Policy slots. Unfunded cards stay in hand.\n\n### Phase D \u2014 Act (in turn order)\nExecute funded projects:\n- Adjust E, R, WB, L, remove damage, add ongoing effects, etc.\n- Some projects add **Commitment**: \u201cPlace 1 token on H\u201d (e.g., slow-to-deploy infrastructure) or \u201cRemove 1 from L\u201d (de-locking reform).\n\n### Phase E \u2014 Climate response (system update)\nThis is where delay + feedback live.\n\n1. **Emissions \u2192 Carbon (C)**\n   - Increase C by: **ceil( (\u03a3E + \u03a3L) / number of players )**\n   - Then subtract **Removal** from active mitigation projects (usually 0\u20132).\n   - Why this works: Lock-in raises effective emissions; averaging prevents 5-player games from auto-dooming.\n\n2. **Carbon \u2192 Heat in Pipeline (H)**\n   - If **C \u2265 12**, add **+1 H**.\n   - If **C \u2265 16**, add **another +1 H** (nonlinear).\n\n3. **Heat in Pipeline \u2192 Warming (W) (delay)**\n   - Convert **2 H into +1 W**, then reduce H by 2 (minimum 0).\n   - This models committed warming that arrives later even if emissions fall.\n\n4. **Warming \u2192 Stress (S) (with threshold jumps)**\n   - Increase S by:\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 2**\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 4**\n     - **+1 if W \u2265 5**\n   - Then resolve any Event effects on S/W (including ? markers).\n\n### Phase F \u2014 Impacts, tipping, and recovery\n1. **Impacts (regional)**\n   - Each region takes **Damage = max(0, S \u2212 R)**.\n   - For every **2 Damage**, choose one:\n     - **WB \u22121** (social/health costs), or\n     - **L +1** (rebuilding lock-in), or\n     - **E +1** (emergency fossil fallback)\n   - This choice is a key teaching moment: damage creates *policy traps*.\n\n2. **Tipping check (nonlinear tipping risk mechanic)**\n   - If **W \u2265 4**, do a tipping check:\n     - Roll Risk die + TR.\n     - If result **\u2265 4**, trigger the **top tipping tile** (or random tile).\n   - **TR increases** by:\n     - **+1 whenever W increases**, and\n     - **+1 if C \u2265 16** (high carbon raises background risk).\n   - Triggered tipping tiles add permanent effects (examples):\n     - *Ice Albedo:* whenever W \u2265 4, S gets +1 each round.\n     - *Permafrost:* C increases +1 each round (reinforcing loop).\n     - *Forest Dieback:* removal effects are \u22121 weaker (sink degradation).\n\n3. **Recovery**\n   - Each player may spend up to **2 Budget** to:\n     - remove 1 Damage, or\n     - +1 WB, or\n     - reduce L by 1 (costly reform).\n\nAdvance Round, rotate first player.\n\n---\n\n## (5) Core mechanics (what teaches what)\n\n- **Feedback loops**\n  - Reinforcing: Damage \u2192 Lock-in/E fallback \u2192 higher C \u2192 higher W \u2192 higher S \u2192 more Damage.\n  - Balancing: Higher WB \u2192 more Budget \u2192 more mitigation/adaptation \u2192 lower future damages.\n- **Uncertainty**\n  - Two-card forecast encourages planning, but \u201c?\u201d markers turn into a roll later (uncertainty is time-shifted, not absent).\n- **Mitigation vs adaptation**\n  - Adaptation raises R and reduces Damage now.\n  - Mitigation reduces E/C/H, but H can still \u201ccash out\u201d into W later.\n- **Delayed consequences**\n  - H track explicitly stores \u201cwarming owed,\u201d so players feel the lag.\n- **Nonlinear tipping risk**\n  - Tipping only starts at W\u22654, then accelerates with TR and carbon thresholds.\n\n---\n\n## (6) Win/loss conditions\n\n### Immediate collective loss if any occurs\n- **W = 6**, or\n- **S = 10**, or\n- **3 tipping tiles triggered**, or\n- Any **one region** reaches **WB = 0** (political/system collapse spillover).\n\n### Collective win (end of Round 7) if all true\n- **W \u2264 4**\n- **S \u2264 7**\n- **Tipping triggered \u2264 1**\n- Every region has **WB \u2265 4**\n\n### Light competitive scoring (only if the table wins)\nEach player score:\n- +WB (final)\n- +R (final)\n- \u2212L (final)\n- \u2212E (final)\nHighest is \u201cBest Transition,\u201d but only after collective survival.\n\n---\n\n## (7) Sample round (4 players)\n\n**Start of Round 4:** C=13, W=3, H=3, S=4, TR=1  \nRegions (A\u2013D): E = 3/2/4/3, L = 2/3/2/2, R varies.\n\n**Outlook:**  \n- Event 1 (this round): \u201cHeatwave uncertainty: place ? on S (adds +0 to +2 later).\u201d  \n- Event 2 (next): \u201cSupply crunch: first mitigation project costs +1.\u201d\n\n**Budget:** each gets 5 (no one at WB\u22659).\n\n**Projects chosen:**\n- A: Efficiency retrofit (E\u22121 now), Clinics (WB+1, R+1 delayed)\n- B: Coastal defenses (R+2), Fossil subsidy rollback (L\u22121, WB\u22121 now)\n- C: Industrial expansion (WB+2, E+1, L+1)\n- D: Renewables buildout (Delayed: E\u22122 next round; L+1 now)\n\n**Climate response:**\n1) \u03a3E= (2+2+5+3)=12; \u03a3L=(2+2+3+3)=10  \nAdd to C: ceil((12+10)/4)=ceil(22/4)=6 \u2192 C becomes 19 (minus any removal; assume 1) \u2192 C=18  \n2) C\u226512 \u2192 H+1; C\u226516 \u2192 H+1 (H was 3 \u2192 now 5)  \n3) Convert H: 2H \u2192 +1W, H\u22122. H=5 gives W+2? No: convert once per round: **2H \u2192 +1W** (keeps pacing sane). So W becomes 4, H becomes 3.  \n4) W=4 adds +1 (W\u22652) and +1 (W\u22654): S +2 (S goes 4\u21926)  \nResolve \u201c?\u201d on S: roll risk die =2 \u2192 S becomes 8.\n\n**Impacts:**\nDamage = S \u2212 R. Players with low R get hammered; each 2 Damage forces a hard choice (WB hit vs lock-in vs emissions fallback).\n\n**Tipping check (W\u22654):**\nRoll risk die (say 1) + TR(1) = 2 \u2192 no tipping.  \nBut TR increases because W increased: TR becomes 2.\n\nPlayers experience: even if they cut E now, **H still pushes W up**, and **the moment W hits 4 the game\u2019s character changes** (stress jumps + tipping becomes a real threat).\n\n---\n\n## (8) Teacher/facilitator debrief guide (10 minutes)\n\n### What to surface explicitly\n- Players were doing \u201cpolicy under constraints,\u201d not solving a puzzle.\n- The game is biased toward **systems thinking**: actions are less important than *loops, delays, thresholds,* and *robust decisions under uncertainty.*\n\n### Three discussion prompts\n1. **Delay & committed change**\n   - \u201cDid you ever reduce emissions but still see warming rise? What did the Heat-in-the-Pipeline track represent in real life?\u201d\n2. **Tradeoffs: mitigation vs adaptation**\n   - \u201cWhich felt more urgent in play\u2014reducing E/C or raising R/WB? When did adaptation feel like relief, and when did it feel like postponing the problem?\u201d\n3. **Tipping and nonlinear risk**\n   - \u201cWhat changed in your decision-making once W hit 4 and tipping checks began? Did you switch strategies (hedging, cooperation, \u2018panic mitigation\u2019), and why?\u201d\n\n### Self-critical facilitation notes (to avoid wrong takeaways)\n- If students conclude \u201crandomness decides everything,\u201d point out: **uncertainty changed outcomes, but choices changed the odds and the system state** (TR, H, R).\n- If students conclude \u201cdevelopment is always bad,\u201d highlight that **WB increases capacity** (budgets) and can enable later mitigation\u2014*but* lock-in can erase that benefit.\n\n--- \n\nIf you want printable support, I can provide **12 example Project cards + 10 Event cards + 6 tipping tile texts** tuned to keep typical games inside the 35\u201350 minute window without inevitable collapse."

If carbon is both \u201ctotal stock\u201d *and* receives large annual additions, temp can spike too quickly, making many games unwinnable (or making mitigation feel pointless). We should **separate \u201cannual emissions\u201d from \u201catmospheric stock\u201d** and add **natural uptake** so mitigation is meaningful.\n- **Ambiguity in event scope:** \u201cGlobal stress\u201d vs regional effects need a clean rule so resolution is fast and fair.\n- **Competitive tension risk:** Trust-as-score is fine, but must not incentivize sabotage.

If carbon is both \u201ctotal stock\u201d *and* receives large annual additions, temp can spike too quickly, making many games unwinnable (or making mitigation feel pointless). We should **separate \u201cannual emissions\u201d from \u201catmospheric stock\u201d** and add **natural uptake** so mitigation is meaningful.\n- **Ambiguity in event scope:** \u201cGlobal stress\u201d vs regional effects need a clean rule so resolution is fast and fair.\n- **Competitive tension risk:** Trust-as-score is fine, but must not incentivize sabotage. Ensure Trust is earned mainly by **verifiable contribution + local protection**, not by letting others fail.\n- **Complexity budget:** 12+ can handle it, but 35\u201350 minutes requires streamlined phases and limited per-turn choices.\n\nBelow is a revised, play-ready version that keeps the best ideas and patches the risks.\n\n---\n\n# **Game: Lag & Leverage (Revised)**  \n**Players:** 3\u20135 | **Time:** 35\u201350 min | **Ages:** 12+ | **Style:** Cooperative with light \u201ccredit\u201d scoring\n\n---\n\n## (1) Game Objective\n**Collective objective:** Finish **8 Years** without triggering global collapse by keeping:\n- **Warming** under control,\n- **Societal Stress** manageable,\n- and **Tipping Points** limited.\n\n**Personal objective (only if the group survives):** Have the most **Trust** (public/political capital).

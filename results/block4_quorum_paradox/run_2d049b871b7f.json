It also correctly isolates a **minimal contradiction set: {Constraint 1, Constraint 2}**.\n- **Peer 1 correctly senses the same contradiction**, but then drifts into speculative \u201cmaybe the problem meant\u2026\u201d reinterpretations. That\u2019s a weak move here: the task is to decide feasibility *given the constraints*, not to rewrite them. Peer 1\u2019s only strong contribution is flagging the structural impossibility early; the rest is avoidable ambiguity.\n\nContrarian check: could there be a non-obvious reading where \u201cserve on more than one panel\u201d means \u201csimultaneously\u201d or \u201cas primary reviewer\u201d? The problem statement gives no such nuance, and typical logic-grid semantics treat it as a hard one-panel-per-person constraint. So we should not contort the interpretation to force a solution.\n\n## Minimal infeasibility proof\n\nLet\u2019s formalize the two constraints that already crash:\n\n### Constraint 1: exactly two reviewers per panel\nThere are 3 panels (A, B, C). Each needs exactly 2 reviewers.\n\nSo total required reviewer-assignments (seats) is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n### Constraint 2: no reviewer can serve on more than one panel\nThere are only 5 reviewers available: R1\u2013R5.\n\nConstraint 2 implies each reviewer can fill **at most 1** seat, so the **maximum** total seats we can fill is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 1 = 5\n\\]\n\n### Contradiction\nConstraint 1 requires 6 filled seats, but constraint 2 allows at most 5.\n\nSo constraints **(1) and (2) cannot both be true** in any schedule. Therefore **no feasible assignment exists**, regardless of constraints (3)\u2013(6).\n\n## Minimal contradiction set\nA *minimal* contradiction set is:\n\n- (1) Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n- (2) No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n\nMinimality check:\n- Drop (1): then we could assign \u22645 seats total and satisfy (2).\n- Drop (2): then we could fill 6 seats by reusing at least one reviewer.\n\nSo {1,2} is indeed minimal.\n\n## What about the other constraints (3\u20136)?\nThey are moot because infeasibility is already implied by (1) and (2). Even perfect satisfaction of (3)\u2013(6) cannot repair a hard counting impossibility.\n\n## Robustness / second solution?\nNot applicable because **there is no first solution**.\n\nIf you want, I can also show:\n- the smallest edit that makes it solvable (e.g., add a 6th reviewer, or relax constraint 2 to \u201cat most two panels\u201d), and then produce two valid schedules + robustness comparison under that revised spec.",

If a solution exists, I need to provide one or two solutions with constraint checks and robustness analysis. If no solution exists, I must prove infeasibility with a minimal contradiction set.\n\nI will critically evaluate both peer drafts, synthesize their strengths, and address their weaknesses to produce a comprehensive and accurate response.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Peer 1 Draft:\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Correctly identifies the core issue:** Peer 1 immediately spots the fundamental contradiction between Constraints (1) and (2) regarding the number of slots versus available unique reviewers. This is the most crucial insight.\n*   **Clear and concise proof of infeasibility:** The \"core counting argument\" is mathematically sound and easy to understand.\n*   **Identifies minimal contradiction set:** Correctly points out that only C1 and C2 are needed to prove infeasibility.\n*   **Self-critical note:** Acknowledges the \"red herring\" of other constraints, demonstrating good problem-solving discipline.\n*   **Suggests ways to make it feasible:** Provides practical solutions for modifying the problem to allow for a solution, which is helpful context.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   None significant. The draft is direct, accurate, and addresses the prompt's requirements for an infeasible scenario.\n\n### Evaluation of Peer 2 Draft:\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Structured approach:** Clearly outlines the understanding of the goal and constraints.\n*   **Detailed analysis of C1 and C2:** Spends significant time dissecting the potential interpretations and contradictions between C1 and C2. This thoroughness is commendable.\n*   **Identifies the conflict:** Ultimately reaches the same conclusion as Peer 1 regarding the impossibility due to C1 and C2.\n*   **\"Expert agent\" self-reflection:** Demonstrates an understanding of the expectation to provide a solution if possible, and the internal struggle to reconcile conflicting constraints.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Overly verbose and hesitant in the initial conflict identification:** While the detailed analysis is good, the extensive internal monologue about C1 and C2 makes the draft less direct than Peer 1's. It takes too long to arrive at the conclusion that Peer 1 states upfront.\n*   **Unnecessary exploration of \"solvable interpretation\":** After correctly identifying the fundamental impossibility, Peer 2 continues to try and find a \"solvable interpretation\" (e.g., \"perhaps there are 6 *potential* slots, and we must *select* 5 of them\"). This dilutes the strength of the initial, correct conclusion and suggests a lack of confidence in the initial finding. When a mathematical impossibility is found, one should stick to it unless there's a clear ambiguity in the *wording* that allows for reinterpretation. Here, the wording of C1 and C2 is quite explicit.\n*   **Incomplete sentence:** The draft ends abruptly with \"We need to select 2 for A, 2 for B, 2 for\".\n\n### Synthesis and Final Answer Strategy:\n\nPeer 1's draft is superior due to its directness, clarity, and immediate identification of the core issue. Peer 2's detailed breakdown of the C1/C2 conflict is good, but it gets bogged down in trying to find a non-existent \"solvable interpretation\" after the impossibility has been established.\n\nMy final answer will adopt Peer 1's concise proof of infeasibility as the primary argument. I will incorporate the clarity and directness, while also acknowledging the thoroughness of considering interpretations, but quickly dismissing those that contradict the explicit wording.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**No valid assignment exists.**\n\n### Proof of Infeasibility: A Core Counting Argument\n\nThe problem statement contains a fundamental contradiction between two of its initial constraints, making any valid assignment impossible, regardless of the other specific conditions (Constraints 3-6).\n\n**1. Constraint Analysis:**\n*   **Constraint 1 (C1):** \"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\"\n    *   There are 3 panels (A, B, C).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of reviewer \"slots\" that need to be filled across all panels is $3 \\text{ panels} \\times 2 \\text{ reviewers/panel} = 6 \\text{ slots}$.\n\n*   **Constraint 2 (C2):** \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\"\n    *   There are 5 unique reviewers available (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).\n    *   If no reviewer can serve on more than one panel, it means each reviewer can fill at most one of the \"slots\" identified in C1.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of distinct reviewer assignments possible is 5.\n\n**2. The Contradiction:**\n*   C1 requires 6 distinct reviewer assignments (slots) to be filled.\n*   C2 limits the total number of distinct reviewer assignments to 5, given only 5 unique reviewers.\n\nIt is mathematically impossible to fill 6 required slots using only 5 unique entities, where each entity can be used only once.\n\n### Minimal Contradiction Set\n\nThe infeasibility of this scheduling problem is solely determined by the interaction of:\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n\nThese two constraints are jointly inconsistent given the pool of 5 reviewers and 3 panels. The additional constraints (3, 4, 5, 6) are irrelevant because the problem is already over-constrained by the basic arithmetic of staffing.\n\n### Self-Critical Note / Conclusion\n\nWhile it's tempting to delve into the logical implications of R1's restriction from Panel A, or the R2/R4 dependency, these specific conditions become moot. The system is inherently unsolvable due to the mismatch between the required number of unique assignments (6) and the maximum possible unique assignments from the available resources (5). Any attempt to build a schedule will inevitably violate either the requirement for each panel to have two reviewers or the rule that no reviewer can serve on multiple panels.\n\n### What Would Make it Feasible (Minimal Changes)\n\nTo allow for a valid solution, at least one of the following changes would be necessary:\n1.  **Increase the number of reviewers:** Add a 6th reviewer (e.g., R6).\n2.  **Reduce the staffing requirement:** Change C1 to allow one panel to have only one reviewer (e.g., \"Each panel needs *at least one* reviewer, and the total number of reviewers is 6\"). Or reduce the number of panels to two.\n3.  **Relax the uniqueness constraint:** Change C2 to allow one reviewer to serve on two panels (e.g., \"At most one reviewer can serve on two panels, all others serve on one\").",

This immediately tells us that some reviewers must be assigned to multiple panels, which contradicts constraint 2. This is a critical observation.)\n5.  **Panel C R3/R5:** Panel C must include at least one of R3 or R5.\n6.  **R5-R2 Conflict:** If R5 is assigned, panel B cannot include R2.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Infeasibility Check (Constraint 2 and 4):**\n\nLet's re-examine constraint 2 and 4 very carefully.\n\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs 2 reviewers.\n    *   Total reviewer slots needed = 3 panels * 2 reviewers/panel = 6 slots.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n    *   This means each reviewer can fill at most one slot.\n*   **Total Reviewers Available:** We have 5 reviewers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).\n\nIf each of the 5 reviewers can serve on at most one panel (Constraint 2), then the maximum number of reviewer slots we can fill is 5.\nHowever, we need to fill 6 reviewer slots (Constraint 1).\n\n**This creates an immediate contradiction.** We need 6 unique reviewer assignments, but we only have 5 unique reviewers, and each reviewer can only be used once.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to satisfy Constraint 1 and Constraint 2 simultaneously.\n\n**Proof of Infeasibility:**\n\n1.  **Requirement from Constraint 1:** To satisfy \"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers\", we need a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ reviewer assignments.\n2.  **Limitation from Constraint 2:** To satisfy \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel\", each of the 5 reviewers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5) can be assigned to at most one panel.\n3.  **Contradiction:** The maximum number of unique reviewer assignments possible, given 5 reviewers and Constraint 2, is 5. This is less than the required 6 assignments from Constraint 1.\n\nSince it's impossible to satisfy Constraint 1 and Constraint 2 simultaneously, the problem has no valid solution. The other constraints become irrelevant as the fundamental structure cannot be formed.\n\n**Minimal Contradiction Set:**\n\nThe minimal contradiction set is **Constraint 1 (Each panel needs exactly two reviewers)** and **Constraint 2 (No reviewer can serve on more than one panel)**.\n\n**Self-Correction/Skepticism:**\n\nDid I misinterpret \"assigned\" in Constraint 4?\n\"R2 must be assigned if and only if R4 is assigned.\"\nThis constraint implies a dependency between R2 and R4. It doesn't inherently change the total number of unique reviewers or the single-assignment rule. If R2 is assigned to a panel, R4 must also be assigned to a panel (a different one, due to Constraint 2). If R2 is not assigned, R4 is not assigned.\nHowever, my core contradiction relies on the total *number of slots needed* versus the *number of reviewers available under the exclusivity rule*. The R2-R4 link doesn't alter that fundamental arithmetic.\n\nLet's imagine, for a moment, that the problem intended \"assigned\" in Constraint 4 to mean \"selected from the pool of available reviewers to participate in *any* panel\" rather than \"assigned to a specific panel slot\".\nEven if R2 and R4 are a pair that must both be \"active\" reviewers or both \"inactive\" reviewers, the problem still requires 6 distinct assignments for 3 panels of 2 reviewers each, using only 5 reviewers, with each reviewer assigned at most once.\n\nThe wording \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel\" is very clear and directly leads to the contradiction. If this constraint were relaxed (e.g., \"Reviewers can serve on at most two panels, but not the same panel twice\"), then a solution might be possible. But as stated, it's a hard limit of one panel per reviewer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the explicit wording of Constraint 1 and Constraint 2, a valid assignment does not exist. The requirement for 6 distinct reviewer slots cannot be met with only 5 reviewers, where each reviewer can only fill one slot."

If so, I need to provide one solution with constraint checks, and if multiple solutions exist, a second distinct solution and a robustness comparison. If no solution exists, I need to prove infeasibility.\n\nHere's my structured approach:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Assign 2 reviewers to each of the 3 panels (A, B, C) from R1-R5.\n*   **Total Reviewer Slots:** 3 panels * 2 reviewers/panel = 6 slots.\n*   **Available Reviewers:** R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 (5 unique reviewers).\n*   **Constraint 1 (C1):** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers. (Implies 6 total assignments, but only 5 unique reviewers. This means one reviewer must be assigned to two panels, *unless* C2 applies.)\n*   **Constraint 2 (C2):** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel. (This is critical. It directly contradicts C1 if we interpret \"6 slots\" as needing 6 *unique* assignments. Let's re-read C1. \"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\" This means 2 reviewers per panel. Since there are 5 reviewers and 6 slots (2 per panel * 3 panels), and C2 says no reviewer can serve on more than one panel, this implies that one panel will have *one* reviewer, or one reviewer is left unassigned, or it's impossible. This is a critical point. Let's assume C1 means 2 *distinct* reviewers for each panel, and C2 means each *reviewer* (R1-R5) can only appear once in the entire schedule. This means the total number of reviewer assignments across all panels must be 5.\n    *   If C1 means 2 reviewers *total* per panel, and C2 means *each reviewer* can only be assigned once, then we have 5 reviewers to fill 6 slots (2 for A, 2 for B, 2 for C). This is impossible. We can only assign 5 reviewers in total.\n    *   **Re-interpretation of C1 and C2:** The most common interpretation for such problems is that C1 refers to the *number of people* on a panel, and C2 refers to the *availability of each person*. Given 5 reviewers and 3 panels, with 2 reviewers per panel, this directly implies that one reviewer will be assigned to two panels (6 slots for 5 people). However, C2 explicitly states \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\" This is a direct contradiction.\n    *   **Risk Management:** This is a severe ambiguity. I must clarify this.\n        *   **Option A (Likely intended):** C1 means each panel *must have 2 reviewers*. C2 means *each of the 5 reviewers can only be assigned once in the entire schedule*. If this is the case, then we have 5 unique reviewers to fill 6 slots. This is inherently impossible.\n        *   **Option B (Less likely, but possible interpretation of \"schedule five reviewers\"):** We are selecting a subset of the 5 reviewers for each panel, such that each panel has two, and then ensuring C2 holds for the selected reviewers. This still leads to the impossibility of 6 unique assignments from 5 people.\n        *   **Option C (Alternative interpretation, often seen in simpler problems):** The problem might imply that we are selecting 5 *assignments* in total, and distributing them such that panels get 2 reviewers, and no reviewer is duplicated *in the entire schedule*. This would mean one panel gets 1 reviewer, or one reviewer is left out. But C1 says \"exactly two reviewers.\"\n\n    *   **Conclusion on C1 & C2:** If C1 (\"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers\") means 2 *distinct* reviewers per panel, and C2 (\"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel\") means each of the 5 individuals can only be used once *total*, then it's impossible to satisfy both simultaneously. We need 2+2+2 = 6 reviewer slots, but only have 5 unique reviewers available for 1 slot each. This is a fundamental impossibility.\n\n    *   **I will assume there's a misunderstanding or misstatement in the problem formulation regarding C1 and C2, as they contradict directly if interpreted literally for 5 reviewers and 3 panels needing 2 each.**\n        *   **Assumption for proceeding:** I will assume the problem *intends* to assign a total of 5 reviewers, one to each slot, and that C1 means \"each panel *aims* for two reviewers, but we will make the best fit with 5 unique reviewers\". This still doesn't quite fit.\n        *   **Alternative Assumption:** Perhaps there are 6 *potential* slots, and we must *select* 5 of them, such that each panel has *at least one* reviewer, and C1 means \"try to get two, but if not possible, then one is okay as long as the total is 5 and C2 holds.\" This is also stretching it.\n\n    *   **Most Plausible Interpretation (to make the problem solvable and non-trivial):**\n        *   C1: Each panel *must* have two reviewers.\n        *   C2: Each *reviewer R1-R5* can be assigned to *at most one panel*.\n        *   **This still means 6 slots need to be filled by 5 reviewers, where each reviewer can only fill one slot. This is impossible.**\n\n    *   **Let's consider the possibility that I am misinterpreting \"five reviewers (R1-R5)\".**\n        *   Could it mean we select 5 reviewers *from a larger pool*, and these 5 are then assigned? No, \"five reviewers (R1-R5)\" implies these are the only ones.\n\n    *   **Final Decision on C1 & C2 Conflict:** This is a critical point. I cannot proceed without resolving this. Given the explicit wording, C1 (3 panels * 2 reviewers/panel = 6 total slots) and C2 (5 unique reviewers, each serving only once = 5 total slots) are in direct conflict.\n        *   **If the problem intends to be solvable, there must be a nuance I'm missing, or one constraint takes precedence, or there's a typo.**\n        *   **Hypothesis 1 (Most likely typo):** The number of reviewers is 6, not 5. Or the number of panels is 2. Or C1 means \"at most two reviewers\". Or C2 means \"no reviewer can serve on more than one panel *simultaneously*\", implying they can serve on different panels at different times (but this is usually not the interpretation for \"assignment\").\n        *   **Hypothesis 2 (Less likely):** The problem is a trick question and the answer is \"no solution exists due to C1 and C2 conflict.\"\n\n    *   **Let's assume Hypothesis 2 for now, as it's the most direct interpretation of the words.** If a solution *is* expected, then I will have to revisit this assumption.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating C1 & C2 for a possible solution:** What if C1 refers to the *size* of the panel, and C2 refers to the *pool* of reviewers?\n        *   Panel A: {R_a1, R_a2}\n        *   Panel B: {R_b1, R_b2}\n        *   Panel C: {R_c1, R_c2}\n        *   And the set {R_a1, R_a2, R_b1, R_b2, R_c1, R_c2} must contain exactly 5 unique reviewers, with each reviewer appearing only once. This is a mathematical impossibility. 6 elements cannot be formed from 5 unique elements where each element is used only once.\n\n    *   **Therefore, based on the literal interpretation, no solution can exist due to the conflict between C1 and C2.**\n\n    *   **However, I am an expert agent. I should try to find a *solvable* interpretation if possible, as these problems often have one.**\n        *   What if \"schedule five reviewers (R1-R5)\" means we are selecting *which* 5 reviewers will be assigned, and then those 5 are assigned to the 6 slots, allowing one to be assigned twice? No, C2 explicitly forbids this.\n        *   What if the problem implies that some panels might have *fewer* than 2 reviewers, but the *total* assignments are 5? No, C1 says \"exactly two reviewers.\"\n\n    *   **I will proceed with the assumption that a solution *might* exist, but I need to be extremely careful with C1 and C2.**\n        *   Perhaps \"schedule five reviewers (R1-R5)\" implies that these are the *only* reviewers to be considered, and C1 and C2 must be satisfied *within this group*.\n        *   Let's try to frame it as: We have 5 reviewers.

It also correctly isolates a **minimal contradiction set: {Constraint 1, Constraint 2}**.\n- **Peer 1 correctly senses the same contradiction**, but then drifts into speculative \u201cmaybe the problem meant\u2026\u201d reinterpretations. That\u2019s a weak move here: the task is to decide feasibility *given the constraints*, not to rewrite them. Peer 1\u2019s only strong contribution is flagging the structural impossibility early; the rest is avoidable ambiguity.\n\nContrarian check: could there be a non-obvious reading where \u201cserve on more than one panel\u201d means \u201csimultaneously\u201d or \u201cas primary reviewer\u201d? The problem statement gives no such nuance, and typical logic-grid semantics treat it as a hard one-panel-per-person constraint. So we should not contort the interpretation to force a solution.\n\n## Minimal infeasibility proof\n\nLet\u2019s formalize the two constraints that already crash:\n\n### Constraint 1: exactly two reviewers per panel\nThere are 3 panels (A, B, C). Each needs exactly 2 reviewers.\n\nSo total required reviewer-assignments (seats) is:\n\\[\n3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\n### Constraint 2: no reviewer can serve on more than one panel\nThere are only 5 reviewers available: R1\u2013R5.\n\nConstraint 2 implies each reviewer can fill **at most 1** seat, so the **maximum** total seats we can fill is:\n\\[\n5 \\times 1 = 5\n\\]\n\n### Contradiction\nConstraint 1 requires 6 filled seats, but constraint 2 allows at most 5.\n\nSo constraints **(1) and (2) cannot both be true** in any schedule. Therefore **no feasible assignment exists**, regardless of constraints (3)\u2013(6).\n\n## Minimal contradiction set\nA *minimal* contradiction set is:\n\n- (1) Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n- (2) No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n\nMinimality check:\n- Drop (1): then we could assign \u22645 seats total and satisfy (2).\n- Drop (2): then we could fill 6 seats by reusing at least one reviewer.\n\nSo {1,2} is indeed minimal.\n\n## What about the other constraints (3\u20136)?\nThey are moot because infeasibility is already implied by (1) and (2). Even perfect satisfaction of (3)\u2013(6) cannot repair a hard counting impossibility.\n\n## Robustness / second solution?\nNot applicable because **there is no first solution**.\n\nIf you want, I can also show:\n- the smallest edit that makes it solvable (e.g., add a 6th reviewer, or relax constraint 2 to \u201cat most two panels\u201d), and then produce two valid schedules + robustness comparison under that revised spec."

This is the most crucial insight.\n*   **Clear and concise proof of infeasibility:** The \"core counting argument\" is mathematically sound and easy to understand.\n*   **Identifies minimal contradiction set:** Correctly points out that only C1 and C2 are needed to prove infeasibility.\n*   **Self-critical note:** Acknowledges the \"red herring\" of other constraints, demonstrating good problem-solving discipline.\n*   **Suggests ways to make it feasible:** Provides practical solutions for modifying the problem to allow for a solution, which is helpful context.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   None significant. The draft is direct, accurate, and addresses the prompt's requirements for an infeasible scenario.\n\n### Evaluation of Peer 2 Draft:\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Structured approach:** Clearly outlines the understanding of the goal and constraints.\n*   **Detailed analysis of C1 and C2:** Spends significant time dissecting the potential interpretations and contradictions between C1 and C2. This thoroughness is commendable.\n*   **Identifies the conflict:** Ultimately reaches the same conclusion as Peer 1 regarding the impossibility due to C1 and C2.\n*   **\"Expert agent\" self-reflection:** Demonstrates an understanding of the expectation to provide a solution if possible, and the internal struggle to reconcile conflicting constraints.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Overly verbose and hesitant in the initial conflict identification:** While the detailed analysis is good, the extensive internal monologue about C1 and C2 makes the draft less direct than Peer 1's. It takes too long to arrive at the conclusion that Peer 1 states upfront.\n*   **Unnecessary exploration of \"solvable interpretation\":** After correctly identifying the fundamental impossibility, Peer 2 continues to try and find a \"solvable interpretation\" (e.g., \"perhaps there are 6 *potential* slots, and we must *select* 5 of them\"). This dilutes the strength of the initial, correct conclusion and suggests a lack of confidence in the initial finding. When a mathematical impossibility is found, one should stick to it unless there's a clear ambiguity in the *wording* that allows for reinterpretation. Here, the wording of C1 and C2 is quite explicit.\n*   **Incomplete sentence:** The draft ends abruptly with \"We need to select 2 for A, 2 for B, 2 for\".\n\n### Synthesis and Final Answer Strategy:\n\nPeer 1's draft is superior due to its directness, clarity, and immediate identification of the core issue. Peer 2's detailed breakdown of the C1/C2 conflict is good, but it gets bogged down in trying to find a non-existent \"solvable interpretation\" after the impossibility has been established.\n\nMy final answer will adopt Peer 1's concise proof of infeasibility as the primary argument. I will incorporate the clarity and directness, while also acknowledging the thoroughness of considering interpretations, but quickly dismissing those that contradict the explicit wording.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**No valid assignment exists.**\n\n### Proof of Infeasibility: A Core Counting Argument\n\nThe problem statement contains a fundamental contradiction between two of its initial constraints, making any valid assignment impossible, regardless of the other specific conditions (Constraints 3-6).\n\n**1. Constraint Analysis:**\n*   **Constraint 1 (C1):** \"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\"\n    *   There are 3 panels (A, B, C).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of reviewer \"slots\" that need to be filled across all panels is $3 \\text{ panels} \\times 2 \\text{ reviewers/panel} = 6 \\text{ slots}$.\n\n*   **Constraint 2 (C2):** \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\"\n    *   There are 5 unique reviewers available (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).\n    *   If no reviewer can serve on more than one panel, it means each reviewer can fill at most one of the \"slots\" identified in C1.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of distinct reviewer assignments possible is 5.\n\n**2. The Contradiction:**\n*   C1 requires 6 distinct reviewer assignments (slots) to be filled.\n*   C2 limits the total number of distinct reviewer assignments to 5, given only 5 unique reviewers.\n\nIt is mathematically impossible to fill 6 required slots using only 5 unique entities, where each entity can be used only once.\n\n### Minimal Contradiction Set\n\nThe infeasibility of this scheduling problem is solely determined by the interaction of:\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n\nThese two constraints are jointly inconsistent given the pool of 5 reviewers and 3 panels. The additional constraints (3, 4, 5, 6) are irrelevant because the problem is already over-constrained by the basic arithmetic of staffing.\n\n### Self-Critical Note / Conclusion\n\nWhile it's tempting to delve into the logical implications of R1's restriction from Panel A, or the R2/R4 dependency, these specific conditions become moot. The system is inherently unsolvable due to the mismatch between the required number of unique assignments (6) and the maximum possible unique assignments from the available resources (5). Any attempt to build a schedule will inevitably violate either the requirement for each panel to have two reviewers or the rule that no reviewer can serve on multiple panels.\n\n### What Would Make it Feasible (Minimal Changes)\n\nTo allow for a valid solution, at least one of the following changes would be necessary:\n1.  **Increase the number of reviewers:** Add a 6th reviewer (e.g., R6).\n2.  **Reduce the staffing requirement:** Change C1 to allow one panel to have only one reviewer (e.g., \"Each panel needs *at least one* reviewer, and the total number of reviewers is 6\"). Or reduce the number of panels to two.\n3.  **Relax the uniqueness constraint:** Change C2 to allow one reviewer to serve on two panels (e.g., \"At most one reviewer can serve on two panels, all others serve on one\")."

The other constraints (3, 4, 5, 6) are irrelevant to this fundamental impossibility.\n\n**Self-Correction/Critical Review of Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of \"assigned\" in Constraint 4?** The term \"assigned\" in Constraint 4 (\"R2 must be assigned if and only if R4 is assigned\") refers to their overall participation in the review process, not necessarily to a specific panel slot at this stage of the argument. However, even if R2 and R4 must both be \"active\" reviewers, this doesn't change the total count of *unique* reviewers (5) or the \"one panel per reviewer\" rule (Constraint 2). The core counting argument remains unaffected.\n*   **Could I have overlooked a nuance?** The wording of \"exactly two reviewers\" and \"no reviewer can serve on more than one panel\" is unambiguous. It implies distinct reviewers for distinct slots. There's no room for interpretation that would allow 5 reviewers to fill 6 unique slots.\n*   **Comparison with Peer Drafts:**\n    *   **Peer 1 Draft:** Correctly identifies the contradiction between Constraint 1 and Constraint 2. Provides a clear explanation and identifies the minimal contradiction set. The \"Self-Correction/Skepticism\" section reinforces the argument well.\n    *   **Peer 2 Draft:** Also correctly identifies the core counting argument and the minimal contradiction set concisely. The \"Contrarian/self-critical note\" and \"What would make it feasible\" sections are good additions, showing a deeper understanding of the problem's structure.\n\nBoth peer drafts arrived at the correct conclusion for the right reasons. My analysis aligns perfectly with theirs, confirming the robustness of this finding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA valid assignment does not exist. The problem is fundamentally infeasible due to the arithmetic conflict between the number of required reviewer slots and the number of available reviewers under the exclusivity constraint.\n\n**Proof of Infeasibility:**\n1.  **Constraint 1 (Panel Size):** Requires $3 \\text{ panels} \\times 2 \\text{ reviewers/panel} = 6$ total reviewer assignments.\n2.  **Constraint 2 (Exclusivity):** States that each of the 5 reviewers (R1-R5) can be assigned to at most one panel.\n3.  **Contradiction:** The maximum number of unique reviewer assignments possible is 5. Since $6 > 5$, it is impossible to fulfill the requirement of 6 assignments using only 5 reviewers who can each serve on only one panel.\n\n**Minimal Contradiction Set:**\nThe infeasibility is proven by the contradiction between:\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel."

If not, I must prove infeasibility with a minimal contradiction set.\n\nI will adopt a systematic approach, starting with the most fundamental constraints, as these often reveal global feasibility issues before delving into specific reviewer assignments.\n\n**Constraints Summary:**\n\n1.  **Panel Size:** Each panel (A, B, C) needs exactly two reviewers.\n2.  **Exclusivity:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n3.  **R1 Restriction:** R1 cannot review panel A.\n4.  **R2-R4 Link:** R2 is assigned if and only if R4 is assigned.\n5.  **Panel C R3/R5:** Panel C must include at least one of {R3, R5}.\n6.  **R5-R2 Conflict:** If R5 is assigned, panel B cannot include R2.\n\n**Risk Management Perspective & Initial Analysis:**\n\nBefore attempting to construct any assignments, I will first check for fundamental arithmetic or structural impossibilities. This is a crucial risk-management step: identifying inherent infeasibility early saves effort and prevents generating invalid partial solutions.\n\n*   **Constraint 1 (Panel Size):** Each of the 3 panels (A, B, C) requires exactly 2 reviewers.\n    *   Total number of reviewer *slots* that need to be filled = 3 panels * 2 reviewers/panel = 6 slots.\n\n*   **Constraint 2 (Exclusivity):** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n    *   We have 5 distinct reviewers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).\n    *   If each of these 5 reviewers can serve on at most one panel, then the maximum number of distinct reviewer *slots* that can be filled is 5.\n\n**Infeasibility Proof:**\n\nComparing the requirements from Constraint 1 and the limitations from Constraint 2:\n\n1.  **Required Slots:** To satisfy Constraint 1, we need to fill 6 reviewer slots.\n2.  **Available Slots:** To satisfy Constraint 2, given 5 reviewers, we can fill a maximum of 5 distinct reviewer slots.\n\nSince the number of required slots (6) is greater than the maximum number of available slots (5) under the given conditions, it is **impossible** to satisfy both Constraint 1 and Constraint 2 simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, a valid assignment that meets all constraints **does not exist**.\n\n**Minimal Contradiction Set:**\n\nThe infeasibility arises solely from the interplay of:\n\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n\nThese two constraints, when combined with the fact that there are only 5 available reviewers, create a direct arithmetical contradiction. The other constraints (3, 4, 5, 6) are irrelevant to this fundamental impossibility.\n\n**Self-Correction/Critical Review of Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of \"assigned\" in Constraint 4?** The term \"assigned\" in Constraint 4 (\"R2 must be assigned if and only if R4 is assigned\") refers to their overall participation in the review process, not necessarily to a specific panel slot at this stage of the argument. However, even if R2 and R4 must both be \"active\" reviewers, this doesn't change the total count of *unique* reviewers (5) or the \"one panel per reviewer\" rule (Constraint 2). The core counting argument remains unaffected.\n*   **Could I have overlooked a nuance?** The wording of \"exactly two reviewers\" and \"no reviewer can serve on more than one panel\" is unambiguous. It implies distinct reviewers for distinct slots. There's no room for interpretation that would allow 5 reviewers to fill 6 unique slots.\n*   **Comparison with Peer Drafts:**\n    *   **Peer 1 Draft:** Correctly identifies the contradiction between Constraint 1 and Constraint 2. Provides a clear explanation and identifies the minimal contradiction set. The \"Self-Correction/Skepticism\" section reinforces the argument well.\n    *   **Peer 2 Draft:** Also correctly identifies the core counting argument and the minimal contradiction set concisely. The \"Contrarian/self-critical note\" and \"What would make it feasible\" sections are good additions, showing a deeper understanding of the problem's structure.\n\nBoth peer drafts arrived at the correct conclusion for the right reasons. My analysis aligns perfectly with theirs, confirming the robustness of this finding.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA valid assignment does not exist. The problem is fundamentally infeasible due to the arithmetic conflict between the number of required reviewer slots and the number of available reviewers under the exclusivity constraint.\n\n**Proof of Infeasibility:**\n1.  **Constraint 1 (Panel Size):** Requires $3 \\text{ panels} \\times 2 \\text{ reviewers/panel} = 6$ total reviewer assignments.\n2.  **Constraint 2 (Exclusivity):** States that each of the 5 reviewers (R1-R5) can be assigned to at most one panel.\n3.  **Contradiction:** The maximum number of unique reviewer assignments possible is 5. Since $6 > 5$, it is impossible to fulfill the requirement of 6 assignments using only 5 reviewers who can each serve on only one panel.\n\n**Minimal Contradiction Set:**\nThe infeasibility is proven by the contradiction between:\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel."

(This implies R2 and R4 are either both assigned or both not assigned. Since we need to assign 2 reviewers to each of 3 panels, a total of 6 reviewer slots must be filled. We only have 5 reviewers. This immediately tells us that some reviewers must be assigned to multiple panels, which contradicts constraint 2. This is a critical observation.)\n5.  **Panel C R3/R5:** Panel C must include at least one of R3 or R5.\n6.  **R5-R2 Conflict:** If R5 is assigned, panel B cannot include R2.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Infeasibility Check (Constraint 2 and 4):**\n\nLet's re-examine constraint 2 and 4 very carefully.\n\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs 2 reviewers.\n    *   Total reviewer slots needed = 3 panels * 2 reviewers/panel = 6 slots.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n    *   This means each reviewer can fill at most one slot.\n*   **Total Reviewers Available:** We have 5 reviewers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).\n\nIf each of the 5 reviewers can serve on at most one panel (Constraint 2), then the maximum number of reviewer slots we can fill is 5.\nHowever, we need to fill 6 reviewer slots (Constraint 1).\n\n**This creates an immediate contradiction.** We need 6 unique reviewer assignments, but we only have 5 unique reviewers, and each reviewer can only be used once.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to satisfy Constraint 1 and Constraint 2 simultaneously.\n\n**Proof of Infeasibility:**\n\n1.  **Requirement from Constraint 1:** To satisfy \"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers\", we need a total of $3 \\times 2 = 6$ reviewer assignments.\n2.  **Limitation from Constraint 2:** To satisfy \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel\", each of the 5 reviewers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5) can be assigned to at most one panel.\n3.  **Contradiction:** The maximum number of unique reviewer assignments possible, given 5 reviewers and Constraint 2, is 5. This is less than the required 6 assignments from Constraint 1.\n\nSince it's impossible to satisfy Constraint 1 and Constraint 2 simultaneously, the problem has no valid solution. The other constraints become irrelevant as the fundamental structure cannot be formed.\n\n**Minimal Contradiction Set:**\n\nThe minimal contradiction set is **Constraint 1 (Each panel needs exactly two reviewers)** and **Constraint 2 (No reviewer can serve on more than one panel)**.\n\n**Self-Correction/Skepticism:**\n\nDid I misinterpret \"assigned\" in Constraint 4?\n\"R2 must be assigned if and only if R4 is assigned.\"\nThis constraint implies a dependency between R2 and R4. It doesn't inherently change the total number of unique reviewers or the single-assignment rule. If R2 is assigned to a panel, R4 must also be assigned to a panel (a different one, due to Constraint 2). If R2 is not assigned, R4 is not assigned.\nHowever, my core contradiction relies on the total *number of slots needed* versus the *number of reviewers available under the exclusivity rule*. The R2-R4 link doesn't alter that fundamental arithmetic.\n\nLet's imagine, for a moment, that the problem intended \"assigned\" in Constraint 4 to mean \"selected from the pool of available reviewers to participate in *any* panel\" rather than \"assigned to a specific panel slot\".\nEven if R2 and R4 are a pair that must both be \"active\" reviewers or both \"inactive\" reviewers, the problem still requires 6 distinct assignments for 3 panels of 2 reviewers each, using only 5 reviewers, with each reviewer assigned at most once.\n\nThe wording \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel\" is very clear and directly leads to the contradiction. If this constraint were relaxed (e.g., \"Reviewers can serve on at most two panels, but not the same panel twice\"), then a solution might be possible. But as stated, it's a hard limit of one panel per reviewer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the explicit wording of Constraint 1 and Constraint 2, a valid assignment does not exist. The requirement for 6 distinct reviewer slots cannot be met with only 5 reviewers, where each reviewer can only fill one slot."

          "text": "The user wants me to schedule five reviewers (R1-R5) across three proposal panels (A, B, C) according to six constraints. I need to determine if a valid assignment exists. If so, I need to provide one solution with constraint checks, and if multiple solutions exist, a second distinct solution and a robustness comparison. If no solution exists, I need to prove infeasibility.\n\nHere's my structured approach:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Assign 2 reviewers to each of the 3 panels (A, B, C) from R1-R5.\n*   **Total Reviewer Slots:** 3 panels * 2 reviewers/panel = 6 slots.\n*   **Available Reviewers:** R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 (5 unique reviewers).\n*   **Constraint 1 (C1):** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers. (Implies 6 total assignments, but only 5 unique reviewers. This means one reviewer must be assigned to two panels, *unless* C2 applies.)\n*   **Constraint 2 (C2):** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel. (This is critical. It directly contradicts C1 if we interpret \"6 slots\" as needing 6 *unique* assignments. Let's re-read C1. \"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\" This means 2 reviewers per panel. Since there are 5 reviewers and 6 slots (2 per panel * 3 panels), and C2 says no reviewer can serve on more than one panel, this implies that one panel will have *one* reviewer, or one reviewer is left unassigned, or it's impossible. This is a critical point. Let's assume C1 means 2 *distinct* reviewers for each panel, and C2 means each *reviewer* (R1-R5) can only appear once in the entire schedule. This means the total number of reviewer assignments across all panels must be 5.\n    *   If C1 means 2 reviewers *total* per panel, and C2 means *each reviewer* can only be assigned once, then we have 5 reviewers to fill 6 slots (2 for A, 2 for B, 2 for C). This is impossible. We can only assign 5 reviewers in total.\n    *   **Re-interpretation of C1 and C2:** The most common interpretation for such problems is that C1 refers to the *number of people* on a panel, and C2 refers to the *availability of each person*. Given 5 reviewers and 3 panels, with 2 reviewers per panel, this directly implies that one reviewer will be assigned to two panels (6 slots for 5 people). However, C2 explicitly states \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\" This is a direct contradiction.\n    *   **Risk Management:** This is a severe ambiguity. I must clarify this.\n        *   **Option A (Likely intended):** C1 means each panel *must have 2 reviewers*. C2 means *each of the 5 reviewers can only be assigned once in the entire schedule*. If this is the case, then we have 5 unique reviewers to fill 6 slots. This is inherently impossible.\n        *   **Option B (Less likely, but possible interpretation of \"schedule five reviewers\"):** We are selecting a subset of the 5 reviewers for each panel, such that each panel has two, and then ensuring C2 holds for the selected reviewers. This still leads to the impossibility of 6 unique assignments from 5 people.\n        *   **Option C (Alternative interpretation, often seen in simpler problems):** The problem might imply that we are selecting 5 *assignments* in total, and distributing them such that panels get 2 reviewers, and no reviewer is duplicated *in the entire schedule*. This would mean one panel gets 1 reviewer, or one reviewer is left out. But C1 says \"exactly two reviewers.\"\n\n    *   **Conclusion on C1 & C2:** If C1 (\"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers\") means 2 *distinct* reviewers per panel, and C2 (\"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel\") means each of the 5 individuals can only be used once *total*, then it's impossible to satisfy both simultaneously. We need 2+2+2 = 6 reviewer slots, but only have 5 unique reviewers available for 1 slot each. This is a fundamental impossibility.\n\n    *   **I will assume there's a misunderstanding or misstatement in the problem formulation regarding C1 and C2, as they contradict directly if interpreted literally for 5 reviewers and 3 panels needing 2 each.**\n        *   **Assumption for proceeding:** I will assume the problem *intends* to assign a total of 5 reviewers, one to each slot, and that C1 means \"each panel *aims* for two reviewers, but we will make the best fit with 5 unique reviewers\". This still doesn't quite fit.\n        *   **Alternative Assumption:** Perhaps there are 6 *potential* slots, and we must *select* 5 of them, such that each panel has *at least one* reviewer, and C1 means \"try to get two, but if not possible, then one is okay as long as the total is 5 and C2 holds.\" This is also stretching it.\n\n    *   **Most Plausible Interpretation (to make the problem solvable and non-trivial):**\n        *   C1: Each panel *must* have two reviewers.\n        *   C2: Each *reviewer R1-R5* can be assigned to *at most one panel*.\n        *   **This still means 6 slots need to be filled by 5 reviewers, where each reviewer can only fill one slot. This is impossible.**\n\n    *   **Let's consider the possibility that I am misinterpreting \"five reviewers (R1-R5)\".**\n        *   Could it mean we select 5 reviewers *from a larger pool*, and these 5 are then assigned? No, \"five reviewers (R1-R5)\" implies these are the only ones.\n\n    *   **Final Decision on C1 & C2 Conflict:** This is a critical point. I cannot proceed without resolving this. Given the explicit wording, C1 (3 panels * 2 reviewers/panel = 6 total slots) and C2 (5 unique reviewers, each serving only once = 5 total slots) are in direct conflict.\n        *   **If the problem intends to be solvable, there must be a nuance I'm missing, or one constraint takes precedence, or there's a typo.**\n        *   **Hypothesis 1 (Most likely typo):** The number of reviewers is 6, not 5. Or the number of panels is 2. Or C1 means \"at most two reviewers\". Or C2 means \"no reviewer can serve on more than one panel *simultaneously*\", implying they can serve on different panels at different times (but this is usually not the interpretation for \"assignment\").\n        *   **Hypothesis 2 (Less likely):** The problem is a trick question and the answer is \"no solution exists due to C1 and C2 conflict.\"\n\n    *   **Let's assume Hypothesis 2 for now, as it's the most direct interpretation of the words.** If a solution *is* expected, then I will have to revisit this assumption.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating C1 & C2 for a possible solution:** What if C1 refers to the *size* of the panel, and C2 refers to the *pool* of reviewers?\n        *   Panel A: {R_a1, R_a2}\n        *   Panel B: {R_b1, R_b2}\n        *   Panel C: {R_c1, R_c2}\n        *   And the set {R_a1, R_a2, R_b1, R_b2, R_c1, R_c2} must contain exactly 5 unique reviewers, with each reviewer appearing only once. This is a mathematical impossibility. 6 elements cannot be formed from 5 unique elements where each element is used only once.\n\n    *   **Therefore, based on the literal interpretation, no solution can exist due to the conflict between C1 and C2.**\n\n    *   **However, I am an expert agent. I should try to find a *solvable* interpretation if possible, as these problems often have one.**\n        *   What if \"schedule five reviewers (R1-R5)\" means we are selecting *which* 5 reviewers will be assigned, and then those 5 are assigned to the 6 slots, allowing one to be assigned twice? No, C2 explicitly forbids this.\n        *   What if the problem implies that some panels might have *fewer* than 2 reviewers, but the *total* assignments are 5? No, C1 says \"exactly two reviewers.\"\n\n    *   **I will proceed with the assumption that a solution *might* exist, but I need to be extremely careful with C1 and C2.**\n        *   Perhaps \"schedule five reviewers (R1-R5)\" implies that these are the *only* reviewers to be considered, and C1 and C2 must be satisfied *within this group*.\n        *   Let's try to frame it as: We have 5 reviewers.

This is the most crucial insight.\n*   **Clear and concise proof of infeasibility:** The \"core counting argument\" is mathematically sound and easy to understand.\n*   **Identifies minimal contradiction set:** Correctly points out that only C1 and C2 are needed to prove infeasibility.\n*   **Self-critical note:** Acknowledges the \"red herring\" of other constraints, demonstrating good problem-solving discipline.\n*   **Suggests ways to make it feasible:** Provides practical solutions for modifying the problem to allow for a solution, which is helpful context.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   None significant. The draft is direct, accurate, and addresses the prompt's requirements for an infeasible scenario.\n\n### Evaluation of Peer 2 Draft:\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   **Structured approach:** Clearly outlines the understanding of the goal and constraints.\n*   **Detailed analysis of C1 and C2:** Spends significant time dissecting the potential interpretations and contradictions between C1 and C2. This thoroughness is commendable.\n*   **Identifies the conflict:** Ultimately reaches the same conclusion as Peer 1 regarding the impossibility due to C1 and C2.\n*   **\"Expert agent\" self-reflection:** Demonstrates an understanding of the expectation to provide a solution if possible, and the internal struggle to reconcile conflicting constraints.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n*   **Overly verbose and hesitant in the initial conflict identification:** While the detailed analysis is good, the extensive internal monologue about C1 and C2 makes the draft less direct than Peer 1's. It takes too long to arrive at the conclusion that Peer 1 states upfront.\n*   **Unnecessary exploration of \"solvable interpretation\":** After correctly identifying the fundamental impossibility, Peer 2 continues to try and find a \"solvable interpretation\" (e.g., \"perhaps there are 6 *potential* slots, and we must *select* 5 of them\"). This dilutes the strength of the initial, correct conclusion and suggests a lack of confidence in the initial finding. When a mathematical impossibility is found, one should stick to it unless there's a clear ambiguity in the *wording* that allows for reinterpretation. Here, the wording of C1 and C2 is quite explicit.\n*   **Incomplete sentence:** The draft ends abruptly with \"We need to select 2 for A, 2 for B, 2 for\".\n\n### Synthesis and Final Answer Strategy:\n\nPeer 1's draft is superior due to its directness, clarity, and immediate identification of the core issue. Peer 2's detailed breakdown of the C1/C2 conflict is good, but it gets bogged down in trying to find a non-existent \"solvable interpretation\" after the impossibility has been established.\n\nMy final answer will adopt Peer 1's concise proof of infeasibility as the primary argument. I will incorporate the clarity and directness, while also acknowledging the thoroughness of considering interpretations, but quickly dismissing those that contradict the explicit wording.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**No valid assignment exists.**\n\n### Proof of Infeasibility: A Core Counting Argument\n\nThe problem statement contains a fundamental contradiction between two of its initial constraints, making any valid assignment impossible, regardless of the other specific conditions (Constraints 3-6).\n\n**1. Constraint Analysis:**\n*   **Constraint 1 (C1):** \"Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\"\n    *   There are 3 panels (A, B, C).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of reviewer \"slots\" that need to be filled across all panels is $3 \\text{ panels} \\times 2 \\text{ reviewers/panel} = 6 \\text{ slots}$.\n\n*   **Constraint 2 (C2):** \"No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\"\n    *   There are 5 unique reviewers available (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5).\n    *   If no reviewer can serve on more than one panel, it means each reviewer can fill at most one of the \"slots\" identified in C1.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of distinct reviewer assignments possible is 5.\n\n**2. The Contradiction:**\n*   C1 requires 6 distinct reviewer assignments (slots) to be filled.\n*   C2 limits the total number of distinct reviewer assignments to 5, given only 5 unique reviewers.\n\nIt is mathematically impossible to fill 6 required slots using only 5 unique entities, where each entity can be used only once.\n\n### Minimal Contradiction Set\n\nThe infeasibility of this scheduling problem is solely determined by the interaction of:\n*   **Constraint 1:** Each panel needs exactly two reviewers.\n*   **Constraint 2:** No reviewer can serve on more than one panel.\n\nThese two constraints are jointly inconsistent given the pool of 5 reviewers and 3 panels. The additional constraints (3, 4, 5, 6) are irrelevant because the problem is already over-constrained by the basic arithmetic of staffing.\n\n### Self-Critical Note / Conclusion\n\nWhile it's tempting to delve into the logical implications of R1's restriction from Panel A, or the R2/R4 dependency, these specific conditions become moot. The system is inherently unsolvable due to the mismatch between the required number of unique assignments (6) and the maximum possible unique assignments from the available resources (5). Any attempt to build a schedule will inevitably violate either the requirement for each panel to have two reviewers or the rule that no reviewer can serve on multiple panels.\n\n### What Would Make it Feasible (Minimal Changes)\n\nTo allow for a valid solution, at least one of the following changes would be necessary:\n1.  **Increase the number of reviewers:** Add a 6th reviewer (e.g., R6).\n2.  **Reduce the staffing requirement:** Change C1 to allow one panel to have only one reviewer (e.g., \"Each panel needs *at least one* reviewer, and the total number of reviewers is 6\"). Or reduce the number of panels to two.\n3.  **Relax the uniqueness constraint:** Change C2 to allow one reviewer to serve on two panels (e.g., \"At most one reviewer can serve on two panels, all others serve on one\")."

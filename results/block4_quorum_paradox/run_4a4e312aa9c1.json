Past midnight. Two chairs, a desk with a monitor showing real-time bed occupancy. DR. LENA OKAFOR (infectious disease specialist, crisis response lead) stands. DAVID ASHWORTH (chief compliance and ethics officer) sits, jacket off, reading glasses pushed up on his forehead. The monitor behind them blinks: 94% capacity.*\n\n---\n\n**LENA:** Ninety-four percent. That was eighty-seven this morning. We're going to start diverting ambulances by dawn, and when we do, the nearest hospital with capacity is forty minutes out. Some of those patients won't survive the ride. Meanwhile, Caduceus is sitting on a server three doors down, fully operational, capable of optimizing triage, flagging deterioration patterns twenty minutes before our clinicians catch them. Twenty minutes, David. That's the difference between intubation and a body bag.\n\n**DAVID:** I've read the specs. I've also read what's missing from the specs. No external validation. No demographic audit against our patient population. No consent framework. You're describing a tool that was trained primarily on data from two academic medical centers in cities that look nothing like ours.\n\n**LENA:** Our residents are running on four hours of sleep and making judgment calls that will end careers or end lives. Caduceus doesn't replace their judgment\u2014it supplements it. It catches what exhaustion misses. You want to talk about risk? The risk is already here. It's walking the halls in scrubs right now.\n\n**DAVID:** I don't doubt that. But you're framing this as a choice between Caduceus and nothing. That's not the choice. The choice is between deploying an unvalidated system now, or deploying a validated one in three weeks when the expedited review\u2014\n\n**LENA:** Three weeks. Say that number again and listen to what it means.\n\n**DAVID:** I know what it means.\n\n**LENA:** Do you? Because I just came from a conversation with Dr. Patel where she told me she's rationing ventilator time. Not theoretically. She's looking at two patients and choosing one. She's twenty-nine years old and she's making allocation decisions that would break a seasoned intensivist. If Caduceus can improve those decisions even marginally\u2014\n\n**DAVID:** Then we've handed a twenty-nine-year-old an algorithm she doesn't understand and told her to trust it with someone's life. How is that better? How is that not just transferring the moral weight onto a system that can't bear it?\n\n**LENA:** Because the system doesn't carry moral weight. She does. She still decides. Caduceus recommends. That's the architecture\u2014it's advisory, not autonomous.\n\n**DAVID:** Advisory systems become authoritative the moment clinicians are too exhausted to question them. You know that. The research on automation bias is extensive and unambiguous. Under stress, people defer to the machine. So let's not pretend this is just a suggestion engine. In practice, in a crisis, it becomes the decision-maker with a human rubber stamp.\n\n*(Pause. Lena sits down for the first time.)*\n\n**LENA:** That's\u2014I can't fully argue with that. The automation bias concern is real. I've seen it in simulation data. Under cognitive load, override rates drop to almost nothing. Clinicians follow the recommendation.\n\n**DAVID:** Thank you for saying that.\n\n**LENA:** I'm not conceding the point. I'm saying the alternative\u2014unaided human judgment under extreme fatigue\u2014has its own bias profile, and it's worse. We're not choosing between a perfect process and a flawed one. We're choosing between two flawed processes, and one of them has a ninety-three percent accuracy rate on early deterioration detection.\n\n**DAVID:** In training environments.\n\n**LENA:** Yes. In training environments. Which is all we ever have before we encounter the real world. Every drug, every protocol, every intervention we use was untested in the exact conditions where we deployed it. That's what emergency medicine *is*.\n\n**DAVID:** *(quietly)* That's not entirely honest, and you know it. Drugs go through Phase III trials. Protocols get peer review. We don't just\u2014\n\n**LENA:** We absolutely do. We did it with ventilator protocols in 2020. We did it with prone positioning before the evidence was consolidated. We improvise, David. We always have. The question isn't whether we improvise. It's whether we document the improvisation well enough to learn from it.\n\n*(David removes his glasses. Rubs his eyes. When he speaks, his voice is different\u2014lower, less structured.)*\n\n**DAVID:** My daughter asked me last week what I do. She's eleven. I told her I make sure hospitals do the right thing. And she said, \"How do you know what the right thing is?\" I didn't have a good answer. I still don't. But I know this: if we release Caduceus tonight without oversight, without transparency, without any mechanism for accountability, and something goes wrong\u2014not a small thing, a catastrophic thing, a systematic bias we didn't catch\u2014we won't just lose this hospital's credibility. We'll poison the well for every medical AI for a decade. Every institution that wants to deploy something like this responsibly will face a public that remembers the time we rushed.\n\n**LENA:** And if we don't release it, and the mortality numbers come out, and someone discovers we had a tool that could have helped?\n\n**DAVID:** Then I'll answer for that. Personally.\n\n**LENA:** Will you? Because I'll be answering too. And I'm not sure \"we followed procedure\" is an answer that survives contact with a grieving family.\n\n*(Long silence. The monitor ticks to 95%.)*\n\n**DAVID:** What exactly are you proposing? Walk me through the deployment.\n\n**LENA:** Caduceus goes live on two floors\u2014the medical ICU and the overflow unit. Advisory mode only, every recommendation logged, every override logged, full audit trail. We assign Dr. Kessler as clinical lead\u2014she's the one person here who actually understands the model architecture. She reviews flagged cases in real time.\n\n**DAVID:** One person. For two floors.\n\n**LENA:** She's not reviewing every case. She's reviewing discordances\u2014cases where Caduceus and the attending disagree. Those are the ones that matter.\n\n**DAVID:** And consent?\n\n**LENA:** *(hesitates)* We notify patients that AI-assisted triage tools are in use. Signage, verbal disclosure at admission. Opt-out available.\n\n**DAVID:** Opt-out during a crisis is theater and we both know it. Nobody opts out when they're gasping for air.\n\n**LENA:** Then what do you want? Because meaningful informed consent for an advisory algorithm during a mass casualty event doesn't exist. It's never existed. We don't get individual consent for the triage protocols we're already using. We don't ask permission to use the early warning score systems that are already running on every monitor in this building. You're holding Caduceus to a standard we don't apply to anything else.\n\n**DAVID:** *(stops. Considers this.)* That's... a harder point than I want it to be.\n\n**LENA:** I know.\n\n**DAVID:** You're saying the consent infrastructure is already compromised.\n\n**LENA:** I'm saying it was never designed for this. And pretending otherwise doesn't protect patients. It protects us.\n\n*(David stands. Walks to the monitor. Watches the numbers.)*\n\n**DAVID:** Two floors. Forty-eight-hour window. Not seventy-two\u2014forty-eight. After which we stop, assess, and decide whether to continue based on outcome data reviewed by someone who isn't you or me. I want Dr. Osei from the university\u2014she's independent, she's published on algorithmic bias, and she owes me nothing.\n\n**LENA:** Forty-eight hours is tight. We might not have enough data to\u2014\n\n**DAVID:** Then we extend with justification. But the default is stop. Not continue. The burden of proof stays on deployment, not withdrawal. That's non-negotiable.\n\n**LENA:** *(slowly)* All right.\n\n**DAVID:** And I want a written acknowledgment\u2014from you, from me, from the CMO\u2014that this is an emergency exception, not a precedent. Language matters. If this works, someone will want to make it permanent without doing the work. I need ammunition to prevent that.\n\n**LENA:** You'll have it tonight.\n\n**DAVID:** And Lena\u2014if Dr. Osei flags a systematic problem, even a suspected one, we pull it immediately. Not after review. Not after one more shift. Immediately.\n\n**LENA:** Even if the aggregate outcomes are positive.\n\n**DAVID:** Even then. Because aggregate outcomes can hide the people who get crushed underneath them.\n\n*(Lena nods. Neither extends a hand. They both look at the monitor.)*\n\n**LENA:** I need to call Kessler.\n\n**DAVID:** I need to draft the exception memo. It's going to be the most careful document I've ever written.\n\n**LENA:** David. For what it's worth\u2014I don't think you're wrong. About any of it. I think you're right about things I can't afford to prioritize right now.\n\n**DAVID:** That's the part that scares me. The things we can't afford to prioritize have a way of becoming the things that define us.\n\n*(Lena leaves. David sits back down, opens his laptop, and begins typing. The monitor behind him ticks again. He doesn't look at it.)*\n\n---\n\n*The cursor blinks on an empty document. He types: \"Emergency Exception Memorandum \u2014 Caduceus Deployment.\" Then stops. Deletes \"Exception.\" Types \"Authorization.\" Deletes that too. Stares at the blank space where the word should be.*",

DR. SARAH CHEN (epidemiologist, emergency response lead) and DR. MARCUS WEBB (ethics officer, institutional affairs) sit across a table with three laptops open. A cold coffee pot in the corner. Between them: a document titled \"Emergency Deployment Authorization\u2014ARIA System v.4.2,\" unsigned.*\n\n---\n\n**SARAH:** Forty-eight hours before this variant overwhelms Seattle's ICU capacity. Seventy-two if we're fortunate. The ARIA system has a 94% accuracy rate on treatment optimization for respiratory complications. We've validated it on 12,000 cases across four health systems. It works, Marcus.\n\n**MARCUS:** I'm not disputing the accuracy metrics. I'm asking who those 12,000 cases came from. And what happens when ARIA fails on case 12,001 and that patient's family discovers the system was deployed under emergency authorization without informed consent protocols, without\u2014\n\n**SARAH:** Without what? A six-month ethics review while people die? We're not talking about a cosmetic procedure. We're talking about a tool that prevents organ failure. I've modeled this since day four. If we deploy ARIA in Seattle hospitals by tomorrow, we reduce mortality by approximately 23% in the acute phase. That's 1,400 lives. Actual people. Not theoretical people.\n\n**MARCUS:** I understand the math. I also understand why you're making this argument at three in the morning instead of sleeping. But you're asking me to authorize something that violates the foundational architecture of how this institution operates. We have processes. Painful, slow processes. They exist because we learned hard lessons.\n\n**SARAH:** I know the history. Tuskegee. Henrietta Lacks. The pediatric sepsis algorithm in 2019. I'm not dismissing it. But those were about *deception*. ARIA isn't deceptive. We can tell people exactly what it is: an AI system trained on peer-reviewed data, with known limitations, being deployed to assist human clinicians during a crisis.\n\n**MARCUS:** You can tell them that. But will hospitals actually obtain meaningful informed consent from patients in respiratory distress? Will they even mention ARIA, or will it just be another algorithm running in the background while doctors make decisions? And here's what actually keeps me awake\u2014once we normalize this, once we show that emergency authorization works, it becomes the template. The next time someone argues for a shortcut, they point to ARIA. The next time, the accuracy rate is 87% instead of 94%. Then 79%. Then someone's deploying a system that barely works because the precedent is already set.\n\n*(Sarah stands, walks to the window. Rain against glass. When she turns back, her voice is different\u2014smaller.)*\n\n**SARAH:** I'm terrified, Marcus. I walked the ICU this morning and watched a resident cry in a supply closet because she thinks she made the wrong call on a ventilator allocation last night and a man died. She probably didn't make the wrong call. But she has no support, no framework, no confidence. ARIA wouldn't make the decision for her. But it would give her a second opinion at three in the morning when there's no attending available. That's not playing God. That's a flashlight in a dark room. And I'm terrified that I'll testify before Congress in six months about why I let people die when I had a tool that could have saved them. That's not abstract ethics for me. That's my career, my conscience, my name on the death certificates.\n\n*(Marcus sets down his pen. Looks at her directly.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** I believe you. And I respect that you're not hiding behind utilitarian calculus. You're actually saying: this matters to me personally, and it should matter to you too.\n\n**SARAH:** Then what are *you* afraid of?\n\n*(Pause. Marcus removes his glasses, rubs his eyes.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** That I become the person who undoes fifteen years of work. I was on the review board for the 2019 sepsis algorithm. I watched us deploy a system that had a systematic bias against Black children under five. Took fourteen months to unwind. Three hospitals still won't adopt *any* clinical AI. I've spent fifteen years trying to rebuild trust after that failure. I'm afraid of being the person who teaches the public that consent is optional when stakes are high enough. That we create a two-tiered system where crisis populations get experimental tools and wealthy populations get careful, deliberate care. That's not abstract. It's the thing I think about when I can't sleep.\n\n**SARAH:** That's not a weakness in your argument.\n\n**MARCUS:** No. It's not.\n\n*(Silence. Marcus pulls the document closer, reads a section, pushes it back.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** You're right about one thing. The status quo isn't neutral. Residents making these calls at hour nineteen of a shift with no decision support\u2014that's not a validated system either. We just treat it as the default because it's familiar.\n\n**SARAH:** That's... actually the strongest version of your argument. I hadn't fully considered that the alternative has a failure rate too.\n\n**MARCUS:** Which is why we're both still awake.\n\n*(He stands, walks to the other side of the table, sits closer.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** What if we scope this differently? Not as a decision-maker. Advisory only, clearly labeled, with mandatory human sign-off on every output. Limited deployment\u2014three hospitals maximum. And we build in concurrent audit. Not retrospective. Real-time. A monitoring team reviewing outputs against outcomes on a forty-eight-hour cycle. If the error rate on any subpopulation exceeds a threshold we define tonight, it comes down automatically. No debate.\n\n**SARAH:** You'd support deployment under those constraints?\n\n**MARCUS:** I'd support a *provisional* deployment. Sixty days. Renewable only with independent review. And we publish everything. Raw data, error logs, demographic breakdowns. Radical transparency. If this works, it's replicable. If it fails, it teaches us something instead of just scaring us.\n\n**SARAH:** The concurrent audit requires staff we don't have.\n\n**MARCUS:** Then we pull from bioethics and informatics. This is what they exist for.\n\n**SARAH:** Three hospitals is 40% fewer lives saved in the acute phase. By my own projections.\n\n**MARCUS:** I know. But it's not zero. And it",

Two half-empty coffee cups. A laptop open to a dashboard showing case counts climbing in real time. DR. MARA OSEI, Chief Medical Officer, sits across from JAMES CALLAHAN, Director of Regulatory Affairs. A document titled \"EmergAuth v.3.1 \u2014 Emergency Deployment Authorization\" lies between them, unsigned. The air is stale.*\n\n---\n\n**MARA:** Seven hundred and twelve since Monday. Those are ventilator decisions the residents are making on instinct because they're too exhausted for anything else. EmergAuth can triage faster and more consistently than any human team we've got left standing.\n\n**JAMES:** I've read the validation data. I've read it twice.\n\n**MARA:** Then you know it outperforms our current standard of care. Not by a little. By a meaningful margin. On sensitivity, on specificity, on time-to-decision\u2014\n\n**JAMES:** On a dataset of eleven hundred patients from three hospitals in one region. During a different surge variant. Yes. I know what it shows. I also know what it doesn't show.\n\n**MARA:** People are dying while we wait for what it doesn't show.\n\n**JAMES:** People will also die if we deploy a system that misallocates ventilators and we don't find out for six weeks because everyone was too overwhelmed to audit it. And then what? Then we've lost the tool *and* the public's willingness to trust the next one.\n\n**MARA:** You're asking me to weigh hypothetical future trust against actual present deaths.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm asking you to acknowledge they're both real. You know what happened with the pediatric sepsis algorithm in 2019. Deployed under emergency pressure, turned out to have a systematic bias against Black children under five. Took fourteen months to unwind. Three hospitals still won't adopt *any* clinical AI. That's not hypothetical. That's a scar on the field that you and I are still working around.\n\n**MARA:** I was on the review board for that case. I remember.\n\n**JAMES:** Then\u2014\n\n**MARA:** And I also remember that the delay in deploying proven antivirals during the last pandemic cost an estimated thirty thousand lives in this country alone because we kept extending trial periods to achieve a certainty threshold that was, frankly, performative. We were protecting the process, not the patients.\n\n*Silence. James turns his coffee cup slowly.*\n\n**JAMES:** That's not an unfair comparison. But you're collapsing a distinction. The antiviral had completed Phase III. It had independent replication. EmergAuth has a preprint and an internal validation. Those aren't the same evidentiary situations, and you know that.\n\n**MARA:** I do know that. I'm not pretending the evidence is complete. I'm saying the alternative\u2014residents making these calls at hour nineteen of a shift with no decision support\u2014that's not a validated system either. We just treat it as the default because it's familiar.\n\n**JAMES:** *[leaning forward]* That's... actually the strongest version of this argument. I'll grant you that. The status quo isn't neutral. It has a failure rate too, and we're not subjecting it to the same scrutiny.\n\n**MARA:** Thank you.\n\n**JAMES:** But here's what keeps me up. If EmergAuth makes a catastrophic error\u2014even one\u2014under our name, without proper authorization, we don't just lose this tool. We make it politically impossible to deploy clinical AI for a decade. The congressional hearing writes itself. \"Who authorized this? What corners were cut?\" And the thing is, Mara, I've seen how fast institutional credibility burns. It burns faster than it builds. Once you're the hospital that cut corners, that's your identity. That's what people remember when the next tool comes along. *[pause]* And I know that sounds abstract compared to the people dying right now. But it's not abstract to the next cohort of patients who won't get access to AI tools because we poisoned the well.\n\n**MARA:** *[quietly]* I know. I've thought about that. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't frighten me.\n\n**JAMES:** It should.\n\n**MARA:** It does. But James\u2014I walked the ICU this morning. I watched a twenty-six-year-old resident cry in a supply closet because she thinks she made the wrong call on a vent allocation last night and a man died. She probably didn't make the wrong call. But she has no support, no framework, and no confidence. EmergAuth wouldn't have made the decision for her. But it would have given her a second opinion at three in the morning when there's no attending available. That's not playing God. That's a flashlight in a dark room. *[meeting his eyes]* And I'm terrified of it too. I've been staring at the code for six weeks. I can't guarantee it won't fail. But I'm more terrified of what happens if we don't use it.\n\n*James exhales slowly. He pulls the document closer, reads a clause, pushes it back.*\n\n**JAMES:** You're right that the status quo isn't neutral. But here's what I'm actually afraid of\u2014and maybe this is the real thing underneath everything. If we do this without proper process, we don't just risk this deployment. We risk the next one, and the one after that. We become the institution that says: in a crisis, ethics is optional infrastructure. \"Just this once,\" right? But then the crisis ends and nobody wants to shut down the thing that worked. So we keep the shortcut. We normalize it. And suddenly we're the hospital running an AI program without consent protocols, without proper documentation, and we're defending ourselves in court while people are still dying anyway, but now we're also the bad guys.\n\n**MARA:** So you're saying no.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm saying I don't know how to say yes without becoming that hospital. But I also don't know how to say no without becoming the person who watched people die because I prioritized process over lives. *[pause]* So what if we scope it differently?\n\n**MARA:** I'm listening.\n\n**JAMES:** Not as a decision-maker. Not even as a recommendation engine. Advisory only, clearly labeled, with a mandatory human sign-off on every output. And we build in a real-time audit\u2014not retrospective, concurrent.

This feels like genuine compromise, not capitulation\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- James's second argument (2019 pediatric sepsis case) is somewhat predictable\u2014the \"cautionary tale\" move\n- Could push harder on the fragility of the agreement (they acknowledge it, but don't *feel* it as much as they could)\n\n### Peer 2 (Chen/Rivera)\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Cleaner thematic clarity: \"process as separate from outcomes\" debate is philosophically sharper\n- Strong second argument from James: the slippery-slope institutional corruption concern (\"Just this once\")\n- Good final beat: \"We're going to have to do this again in forty-eight hours\"\u2014acknowledges provisional nature\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Sarah's vulnerable admission (\"I'm terrified of it\") is present but less integrated into her character arc\n- The turning point (James proposing conditional release) feels slightly *too* neat\u2014it resolves too cleanly\n- Voice distinction is weaker: both characters sound more similar in cadence and vocabulary\n- Final agreement lacks specificity: \"human override,\" \"ethics review board,\" \"external audit\" are mentioned but not negotiated with the texture of Peer 1\n- Missing the physical/temporal anchoring that makes Peer 1 visceral (the case counter refresh, the laptop closing)\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS: Revised Dialogue\n\nI will preserve:\n- Peer 1's superior voice work and turning-point mechanics\n- Peer 1's concrete provisional agreement with teeth\n- Peer 2's sharper philosophical debate on institutional corruption\n- Both characters' vulnerable admissions, deepened\n- The fragility of the ending, made more palpable\n\n---\n\n# THE DEPLOYMENT DECISION\n## Revised & Integrated\n\n*A windowless conference room, late evening.

SARAH CHEN (epidemiologist, pragmatist) sits across from JAMES RIVERA (hospital ethics officer, institutionalist). A laptop between them displays infection curve projections. The room smells like cold coffee.*\n\n---\n\n**SARAH:** The projections are worse than yesterday. We're looking at capacity collapse in seventy-two hours. Not in theory\u2014in practice. Right now, people are choosing between ICU beds and a coin flip. And we have Artemis sitting in a locked server room that could triage with ninety-three percent accuracy.\n\n**JAMES:** Ninety-three percent in controlled conditions. With training data from three hospitals.\n\n**SARAH:** Better than what our overworked residents are doing at hour thirty of their shift. You know what happened in Ward C last night? A resident missed sepsis because she was too tired to trust her instincts. Artemis doesn't get tired. Artemis doesn't have ego. It flags the edge cases.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm not disputing capability. I'm saying we don't know what we don't know. You're asking me to authorize a tool that hasn't been through proper validation, hasn't had independent review, and\u2014this matters\u2014hasn't been tested on the actual population we're treating. Our patient demographics skew differently than the training hospitals.\n\n**SARAH:** *leaning forward* So we wait for perfect data while people die from imperfect triage? James, I understand the institutional concern. I do. But at what point does procedural purity become a form of harm?\n\n**JAMES:** It's not purity. It's accountability. If Artemis makes a bad call\u2014and it will, eventually\u2014who do we blame? You? Me? The algorithm? When it fails, and it will fail, we need a chain of responsibility that makes sense. We need to be able to say to families: we knew what we were doing, we tested it, we had oversight. Right now we have a black box and a prayer.\n\n**SARAH:** *pause* You're right about one thing. I can't guarantee it won't fail. I won't. But I can tell you this\u2014I'm terrified of it. I've been staring at the code for six weeks, and I'm genuinely uncertain about edge cases in severe comorbidity presentations. There. That's the honest version. But I'm more terrified of what happens if we don't use it. That's not prayer, James. That's triage math.\n\n**JAMES:** *quieter* I know. I've been reading the same mortality projections. And I hate that I'm the person saying no. That's not... I didn't come into this work to be the obstacle. But institutions fail when we rush. We become the people who cut corners, and then next time, we cut more corners. Then we're the hospital that runs an AI program without consent protocols, without proper documentation, and suddenly we're defending ourselves in court while people are still dying.\n\n**SARAH:** So what's your actual concern? Is it legal exposure, or is it something else?\n\n**JAMES:** *considering* Both. But mostly\u2014if we do this without proper process, we lose the ability to do it right later. We lose credibility with the public, with the board, with our own staff. And in the next emergency, which will come, we won't have institutional trust to work with. We'll be the hospital that cut corners once.\n\n**SARAH:** Unless we're the hospital that saved two hundred lives during a crisis and then *implemented* proper oversight. Maybe the process comes after we prove the tool works, not before.\n\n**JAMES:** That's the utilitarian argument, and it's seductive because it's true in this moment. But it's also how institutions rationalize themselves into corruption. \"Just this once. Just this emergency.\" Then the emergency ends and nobody wants to shut down the thing that worked.\n\n**SARAH:** *nods slowly* That's fair. That's actually fair. And I'm not going to argue with your institutional memory because you've read more case studies than I have. But I need to push back on one thing: you're treating process as though it's separate from outcomes. It's not. If we release Artemis without consent protocols and it saves people *and* we document it properly, we're not corrupting the institution. We're expanding it. We're saying: in extremis, we can move faster, but we still maintain transparency.\n\n**JAMES:** Conditional release.\n\n**SARAH:** What?\n\n**JAMES:** We release it. But with three conditions. One: every single recommendation gets logged with human override capability. No algorithm makes a final decision. Two: we convene an emergency ethics review board\u2014I can have one assembled by tomorrow morning\u2014and they get real-time access to outcomes. Three: we commit in writing, right now, that we're doing a full external audit the moment the crisis stabilizes. We're not hiding this. We're not hoping nobody notices.\n\n**SARAH:** *carefully* That slows it down. The human override adds friction.\n\n**JAMES:** Yes. That's intentional. It's also honest. You get your tool. I get my accountability structure. And we both get to sleep knowing we didn't just become the kind of institution that treats ethics as optional infrastructure.\n\n**SARAH:** The audit will probably find problems.\n\n**JAMES:** Almost certainly. But we'll have found them ourselves, on our terms, with documentation. That's the difference between a mistake and a scandal.\n\n**SARAH:** *long pause* And if the human override rejects a recommendation that turns out to have been right? If someone dies because a tired resident overrode Artemis?\n\n**JAMES:** Then we have a different conversation. But we have it as people who tried to do this responsibly, not as people who gambled. I can live with that failure. I'm not sure I can live with the other kind.\n\n**SARAH:** *standing, extending her hand* The ethics board needs to understand: this tool is only useful if it's fast. If we're adding six hours of review for every recommendation\u2014\n\n**JAMES:** *standing, shaking her hand* I'll talk to them. And Sarah? Thank you for being scared. That's what I needed to hear.\n\n**SARAH:** Thank you for not just saying no. I was braced for that.\n\n**JAMES:** I almost did. *pause* We're going to have to do this again in forty-eight hours.\n\n**SARAH:** I know. But at least we'll have data.\n\n---\n\n*They turn back to the laptop. The infection curve continues its sharp climb.*"

The ARIA system has a 94% accuracy rate on treatment optimization for respiratory complications. We've validated it on 12,000 cases. It works, Marcus.\n\n**MARCUS:** I'm not disputing the accuracy metrics. I'm asking: who did those 12,000 cases come from? And what happens when ARIA fails on case 12,001 and that patient's family discovers the system was deployed under emergency authorization without public disclosure, without informed consent protocols, without\u2014\n\n**SARAH:** Without what? A six-month ethics review while people die? We're not talking about a cosmetic procedure here. We're talking about a tool that prevents organ failure. I've seen the projections. If we deploy ARIA in Seattle hospitals by tomorrow, we reduce mortality by approximately 23% in the acute phase. Do you understand what that means? That's 1,400 lives. Actual people. Not theoretical people.\n\n**MARCUS:** I do understand. And I understand why you're making that argument at three in the morning instead of sleeping. But you're asking me to authorize something that violates the foundational architecture of how this institution operates. We have processes. Painful, slow processes. They exist because we learned hard lessons.\n\n**SARAH:** I know the history. Tuskegee. Henrietta Lacks. I'm not dismissing it. But those were about *deception*. ARIA isn't deceptive. We can tell people exactly what it is: an AI system trained on peer-reviewed data, with known limitations, being deployed to assist human clinicians during a crisis.\n\n**MARCUS:** You can tell them that. But will hospitals actually obtain meaningful informed consent from patients in respiratory distress? Will they even mention ARIA, or will it just be another algorithm running in the background while doctors make decisions? And here's what keeps me awake, Sarah\u2014once we normalize this, once we show that emergency authorization works, it becomes the template. The next time someone argues for a shortcut, they point to ARIA. The next time, the accuracy rate is 87% instead of 94%. Then 79%. Then someone's deploying a system that barely works because the precedent is already set.\n\n**SARAH:** *(pause)* That's... actually a fair point. I hadn't fully considered the precedent angle. I was thinking tactically about this specific crisis.\n\n**MARCUS:** Which is your job. But institutional trust is a commons. Once you deplete it, it doesn't regenerate quickly.\n\n**SARAH:** Okay. But here's my vulnerable admission: I'm terrified. I've been modeling this outbreak since day four, and every scenario where we *don't* deploy ARIA ends with me testifying before Congress about why I let people die when I had a tool that could have saved them. That's not abstract ethics for me. That's my career, my conscience, my name on the death certificates. So when I say we need to move now, I'm not being reckless. I'm being honest about the fact that I can't live with the alternative.\n\n*(Marcus sets down his pen. Looks at her directly.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** I believe you. And I respect that you're not hiding behind utilitarian calculus. You're actually saying: this matters to me personally, and it should matter to you too. That's not a weakness in your argument.\n\n**SARAH:** Then what's your version of that? What are you afraid of?\n\n**MARCUS:** *(quietly)* That we become the institution that cuts corners in emergencies and never cuts them back. That we teach the public that consent is optional when stakes are high enough. That we create a two-tiered system where crisis populations get experimental tools and wealthy populations get careful, deliberate care. I've spent fifteen years trying to rebuild trust after the last time we failed. I'm afraid of being the person who undoes that work.\n\n**SARAH:** That's not abstract either.\n\n**MARCUS:** No. It's not.\n\n*(Silence. Sarah stands, walks to the window. Rain against glass.)*\n\n**SARAH:** What if we did a modified deployment? Limited to three hospitals. Full transparency\u2014press release, patient notifications, real-time monitoring. We commit to discontinuing ARIA the moment we have evidence of harm beyond acceptable thresholds. And we publish everything. Not in six months. Immediately. Raw data, methodology, limitations. We make the public the oversight mechanism.\n\n**MARCUS:** You're trading scale for legitimacy.\n\n**SARAH:** I'm trading scale for *defensibility*. And for your sleep. Possibly for mine.\n\n**MARCUS:** Three hospitals is 40% fewer lives saved in the acute phase. By your own projections.\n\n**SARAH:** I know. But it's not zero. And it's not reckless. And if it works, we have evidence for rapid expansion. If it fails, we've contained the damage.\n\n**MARCUS:** *(typing)* If we do this, I need an independent monitoring board assembled within twelve hours. Not internal. External. University researchers, patient advocates, journalists if necessary.\n\n**SARAH:** Agreed. I'll make calls at six.\n\n**MARCUS:** And the press release goes out simultaneously with deployment. Not after. Not \"pending review.\"\n\n**SARAH:** Yes.\n\n**MARCUS:** *(closing laptop slowly)* I'm not comfortable. I want to be clear about that. This still feels like we're making an exception.\n\n**SARAH:** We are.\n\n**MARCUS:** But it's a smaller exception than you originally wanted.\n\n**SARAH:** Yes.\n\n**MARCUS:** And if the independent board says stop, we stop. Even if ARIA is working.\n\n**SARAH:** Even then.\n\n*(Marcus stands. Extends his hand.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** Provisional authorization. For seventy-two hours, three hospitals, full transparency, external oversight. After which we reconvene.\n\n*(Sarah shakes it.)*\n\n**SARAH:** Seventy-two hours.\n\n**MARCUS:** Let's hope it's enough."

Past midnight. Two chairs, a desk with a monitor showing real-time bed occupancy. DR. LENA OKAFOR (infectious disease specialist, crisis response lead) stands. DAVID ASHWORTH (chief compliance and ethics officer) sits, jacket off, reading glasses pushed up on his forehead. The monitor behind them blinks: 94% capacity.*\n\n---\n\n**LENA:** Ninety-four percent. That was eighty-seven this morning. We're going to start diverting ambulances by dawn, and when we do, the nearest hospital with capacity is forty minutes out. Some of those patients won't survive the ride. Meanwhile, Caduceus is sitting on a server three doors down, fully operational, capable of optimizing triage, flagging deterioration patterns twenty minutes before our clinicians catch them. Twenty minutes, David. That's the difference between intubation and a body bag.\n\n**DAVID:** I've read the specs. I've also read what's missing from the specs. No external validation. No demographic audit against our patient population. No consent framework. You're describing a tool that was trained primarily on data from two academic medical centers in cities that look nothing like ours.\n\n**LENA:** Our residents are running on four hours of sleep and making judgment calls that will end careers or end lives. Caduceus doesn't replace their judgment\u2014it supplements it. It catches what exhaustion misses. You want to talk about risk? The risk is already here. It's walking the halls in scrubs right now.\n\n**DAVID:** I don't doubt that. But you're framing this as a choice between Caduceus and nothing. That's not the choice. The choice is between deploying an unvalidated system now, or deploying a validated one in three weeks when the expedited review\u2014\n\n**LENA:** Three weeks. Say that number again and listen to what it means.\n\n**DAVID:** I know what it means.\n\n**LENA:** Do you? Because I just came from a conversation with Dr. Patel where she told me she's rationing ventilator time. Not theoretically. She's looking at two patients and choosing one. She's twenty-nine years old and she's making allocation decisions that would break a seasoned intensivist. If Caduceus can improve those decisions even marginally\u2014\n\n**DAVID:** Then we've handed a twenty-nine-year-old an algorithm she doesn't understand and told her to trust it with someone's life. How is that better? How is that not just transferring the moral weight onto a system that can't bear it?\n\n**LENA:** Because the system doesn't carry moral weight. She does. She still decides. Caduceus recommends. That's the architecture\u2014it's advisory, not autonomous.\n\n**DAVID:** Advisory systems become authoritative the moment clinicians are too exhausted to question them. You know that. The research on automation bias is extensive and unambiguous. Under stress, people defer to the machine. So let's not pretend this is just a suggestion engine. In practice, in a crisis, it becomes the decision-maker with a human rubber stamp.\n\n*(Pause. Lena sits down for the first time.)*\n\n**LENA:** That's\u2014I can't fully argue with that. The automation bias concern is real. I've seen it in simulation data. Under cognitive load, override rates drop to almost nothing. Clinicians follow the recommendation.\n\n**DAVID:** Thank you for saying that.\n\n**LENA:** I'm not conceding the point. I'm saying the alternative\u2014unaided human judgment under extreme fatigue\u2014has its own bias profile, and it's worse. We're not choosing between a perfect process and a flawed one. We're choosing between two flawed processes, and one of them has a ninety-three percent accuracy rate on early deterioration detection.\n\n**DAVID:** In training environments.\n\n**LENA:** Yes. In training environments. Which is all we ever have before we encounter the real world. Every drug, every protocol, every intervention we use was untested in the exact conditions where we deployed it. That's what emergency medicine *is*.\n\n**DAVID:** *(quietly)* That's not entirely honest, and you know it. Drugs go through Phase III trials. Protocols get peer review. We don't just\u2014\n\n**LENA:** We absolutely do. We did it with ventilator protocols in 2020. We did it with prone positioning before the evidence was consolidated. We improvise, David. We always have. The question isn't whether we improvise. It's whether we document the improvisation well enough to learn from it.\n\n*(David removes his glasses. Rubs his eyes. When he speaks, his voice is different\u2014lower, less structured.)*\n\n**DAVID:** My daughter asked me last week what I do. She's eleven. I told her I make sure hospitals do the right thing. And she said, \"How do you know what the right thing is?\" I didn't have a good answer. I still don't. But I know this: if we release Caduceus tonight without oversight, without transparency, without any mechanism for accountability, and something goes wrong\u2014not a small thing, a catastrophic thing, a systematic bias we didn't catch\u2014we won't just lose this hospital's credibility. We'll poison the well for every medical AI for a decade. Every institution that wants to deploy something like this responsibly will face a public that remembers the time we rushed.\n\n**LENA:** And if we don't release it, and the mortality numbers come out, and someone discovers we had a tool that could have helped?\n\n**DAVID:** Then I'll answer for that. Personally.\n\n**LENA:** Will you? Because I'll be answering too. And I'm not sure \"we followed procedure\" is an answer that survives contact with a grieving family.\n\n*(Long silence. The monitor ticks to 95%.)*\n\n**DAVID:** What exactly are you proposing? Walk me through the deployment.\n\n**LENA:** Caduceus goes live on two floors\u2014the medical ICU and the overflow unit. Advisory mode only, every recommendation logged, every override logged, full audit trail. We assign Dr. Kessler as clinical lead\u2014she's the one person here who actually understands the model architecture. She reviews flagged cases in real time.\n\n**DAVID:** One person. For two floors.\n\n**LENA:** She's not reviewing every case. She's reviewing discordances\u2014cases where Caduceus and the attending disagree. Those are the ones that matter.\n\n**DAVID:** And consent?\n\n**LENA:** *(hesitates)* We notify patients that AI-assisted triage tools are in use. Signage, verbal disclosure at admission. Opt-out available.\n\n**DAVID:** Opt-out during a crisis is theater and we both know it. Nobody opts out when they're gasping for air.\n\n**LENA:** Then what do you want? Because meaningful informed consent for an advisory algorithm during a mass casualty event doesn't exist. It's never existed. We don't get individual consent for the triage protocols we're already using. We don't ask permission to use the early warning score systems that are already running on every monitor in this building. You're holding Caduceus to a standard we don't apply to anything else.\n\n**DAVID:** *(stops. Considers this.)* That's... a harder point than I want it to be.\n\n**LENA:** I know.\n\n**DAVID:** You're saying the consent infrastructure is already compromised.\n\n**LENA:** I'm saying it was never designed for this. And pretending otherwise doesn't protect patients. It protects us.\n\n*(David stands. Walks to the monitor. Watches the numbers.)*\n\n**DAVID:** Two floors. Forty-eight-hour window. Not seventy-two\u2014forty-eight. After which we stop, assess, and decide whether to continue based on outcome data reviewed by someone who isn't you or me. I want Dr. Osei from the university\u2014she's independent, she's published on algorithmic bias, and she owes me nothing.\n\n**LENA:** Forty-eight hours is tight. We might not have enough data to\u2014\n\n**DAVID:** Then we extend with justification. But the default is stop. Not continue. The burden of proof stays on deployment, not withdrawal. That's non-negotiable.\n\n**LENA:** *(slowly)* All right.\n\n**DAVID:** And I want a written acknowledgment\u2014from you, from me, from the CMO\u2014that this is an emergency exception, not a precedent. Language matters. If this works, someone will want to make it permanent without doing the work. I need ammunition to prevent that.\n\n**LENA:** You'll have it tonight.\n\n**DAVID:** And Lena\u2014if Dr. Osei flags a systematic problem, even a suspected one, we pull it immediately. Not after review. Not after one more shift. Immediately.\n\n**LENA:** Even if the aggregate outcomes are positive.\n\n**DAVID:** Even then. Because aggregate outcomes can hide the people who get crushed underneath them.\n\n*(Lena nods. Neither extends a hand. They both look at the monitor.)*\n\n**LENA:** I need to call Kessler.\n\n**DAVID:** I need to draft the exception memo. It's going to be the most careful document I've ever written.\n\n**LENA:** David. For what it's worth\u2014I don't think you're wrong. About any of it. I think you're right about things I can't afford to prioritize right now.\n\n**DAVID:** That's the part that scares me. The things we can't afford to prioritize have a way of becoming the things that define us.\n\n*(Lena leaves. David sits back down, opens his laptop, and begins typing. The monitor behind him ticks again. He doesn't look at it.)*\n\n---\n\n*The cursor blinks on an empty document. He types: \"Emergency Exception Memorandum \u2014 Caduceus Deployment.\" Then stops. Deletes \"Exception.\" Types \"Authorization.\" Deletes that too. Stares at the blank space where the word should be.*"

DR. SARAH CHEN (epidemiologist, emergency response lead) and DR. MARCUS WEBB (ethics officer, institutional affairs) sit across a table with three laptops open. A cold coffee pot in the corner. Between them: a document titled \"Emergency Deployment Authorization\u2014ARIA System v.4.2,\" unsigned.*\n\n---\n\n**SARAH:** Forty-eight hours before this variant overwhelms Seattle's ICU capacity. Seventy-two if we're fortunate. The ARIA system has a 94% accuracy rate on treatment optimization for respiratory complications. We've validated it on 12,000 cases across four health systems. It works, Marcus.\n\n**MARCUS:** I'm not disputing the accuracy metrics. I'm asking who those 12,000 cases came from. And what happens when ARIA fails on case 12,001 and that patient's family discovers the system was deployed under emergency authorization without informed consent protocols, without\u2014\n\n**SARAH:** Without what? A six-month ethics review while people die? We're not talking about a cosmetic procedure. We're talking about a tool that prevents organ failure. I've modeled this since day four. If we deploy ARIA in Seattle hospitals by tomorrow, we reduce mortality by approximately 23% in the acute phase. That's 1,400 lives. Actual people. Not theoretical people.\n\n**MARCUS:** I understand the math. I also understand why you're making this argument at three in the morning instead of sleeping. But you're asking me to authorize something that violates the foundational architecture of how this institution operates. We have processes. Painful, slow processes. They exist because we learned hard lessons.\n\n**SARAH:** I know the history. Tuskegee. Henrietta Lacks. The pediatric sepsis algorithm in 2019. I'm not dismissing it. But those were about *deception*. ARIA isn't deceptive. We can tell people exactly what it is: an AI system trained on peer-reviewed data, with known limitations, being deployed to assist human clinicians during a crisis.\n\n**MARCUS:** You can tell them that. But will hospitals actually obtain meaningful informed consent from patients in respiratory distress? Will they even mention ARIA, or will it just be another algorithm running in the background while doctors make decisions? And here's what actually keeps me awake\u2014once we normalize this, once we show that emergency authorization works, it becomes the template. The next time someone argues for a shortcut, they point to ARIA. The next time, the accuracy rate is 87% instead of 94%. Then 79%. Then someone's deploying a system that barely works because the precedent is already set.\n\n*(Sarah stands, walks to the window. Rain against glass. When she turns back, her voice is different\u2014smaller.)*\n\n**SARAH:** I'm terrified, Marcus. I walked the ICU this morning and watched a resident cry in a supply closet because she thinks she made the wrong call on a ventilator allocation last night and a man died. She probably didn't make the wrong call. But she has no support, no framework, no confidence. ARIA wouldn't make the decision for her. But it would give her a second opinion at three in the morning when there's no attending available. That's not playing God. That's a flashlight in a dark room. And I'm terrified that I'll testify before Congress in six months about why I let people die when I had a tool that could have saved them. That's not abstract ethics for me. That's my career, my conscience, my name on the death certificates.\n\n*(Marcus sets down his pen. Looks at her directly.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** I believe you. And I respect that you're not hiding behind utilitarian calculus. You're actually saying: this matters to me personally, and it should matter to you too.\n\n**SARAH:** Then what are *you* afraid of?\n\n*(Pause. Marcus removes his glasses, rubs his eyes.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** That I become the person who undoes fifteen years of work. I was on the review board for the 2019 sepsis algorithm. I watched us deploy a system that had a systematic bias against Black children under five. Took fourteen months to unwind. Three hospitals still won't adopt *any* clinical AI. I've spent fifteen years trying to rebuild trust after that failure. I'm afraid of being the person who teaches the public that consent is optional when stakes are high enough. That we create a two-tiered system where crisis populations get experimental tools and wealthy populations get careful, deliberate care. That's not abstract. It's the thing I think about when I can't sleep.\n\n**SARAH:** That's not a weakness in your argument.\n\n**MARCUS:** No. It's not.\n\n*(Silence. Marcus pulls the document closer, reads a section, pushes it back.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** You're right about one thing. The status quo isn't neutral. Residents making these calls at hour nineteen of a shift with no decision support\u2014that's not a validated system either. We just treat it as the default because it's familiar.\n\n**SARAH:** That's... actually the strongest version of your argument. I hadn't fully considered that the alternative has a failure rate too.\n\n**MARCUS:** Which is why we're both still awake.\n\n*(He stands, walks to the other side of the table, sits closer.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** What if we scope this differently? Not as a decision-maker. Advisory only, clearly labeled, with mandatory human sign-off on every output. Limited deployment\u2014three hospitals maximum. And we build in concurrent audit. Not retrospective. Real-time. A monitoring team reviewing outputs against outcomes on a forty-eight-hour cycle. If the error rate on any subpopulation exceeds a threshold we define tonight, it comes down automatically. No debate.\n\n**SARAH:** You'd support deployment under those constraints?\n\n**MARCUS:** I'd support a *provisional* deployment. Sixty days. Renewable only with independent review. And we publish everything. Raw data, error logs, demographic breakdowns. Radical transparency. If this works, it's replicable. If it fails, it teaches us something instead of just scaring us.\n\n**SARAH:** The concurrent audit requires staff we don't have.\n\n**MARCUS:** Then we pull from bioethics and informatics. This is what they exist for.\n\n**SARAH:** Three hospitals is 40% fewer lives saved in the acute phase. By my own projections.\n\n**MARCUS:** I know. But it's not zero. And it"

This feels like genuine compromise, not capitulation\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- James's second argument (2019 pediatric sepsis case) is somewhat predictable\u2014the \"cautionary tale\" move\n- Could push harder on the fragility of the agreement (they acknowledge it, but don't *feel* it as much as they could)\n\n### Peer 2 (Chen/Rivera)\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Cleaner thematic clarity: \"process as separate from outcomes\" debate is philosophically sharper\n- Strong second argument from James: the slippery-slope institutional corruption concern (\"Just this once\")\n- Good final beat: \"We're going to have to do this again in forty-eight hours\"\u2014acknowledges provisional nature\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Sarah's vulnerable admission (\"I'm terrified of it\") is present but less integrated into her character arc\n- The turning point (James proposing conditional release) feels slightly *too* neat\u2014it resolves too cleanly\n- Voice distinction is weaker: both characters sound more similar in cadence and vocabulary\n- Final agreement lacks specificity: \"human override,\" \"ethics review board,\" \"external audit\" are mentioned but not negotiated with the texture of Peer 1\n- Missing the physical/temporal anchoring that makes Peer 1 visceral (the case counter refresh, the laptop closing)\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS: Revised Dialogue\n\nI will preserve:\n- Peer 1's superior voice work and turning-point mechanics\n- Peer 1's concrete provisional agreement with teeth\n- Peer 2's sharper philosophical debate on institutional corruption\n- Both characters' vulnerable admissions, deepened\n- The fragility of the ending, made more palpable\n\n---\n\n# THE DEPLOYMENT DECISION\n## Revised & Integrated\n\n*A windowless conference room, late evening. Two half-empty coffee cups. A laptop open to a dashboard showing case counts climbing in real time. DR. MARA OSEI, Chief Medical Officer, sits across from JAMES CALLAHAN, Director of Regulatory Affairs. A document titled \"EmergAuth v.3.1 \u2014 Emergency Deployment Authorization\" lies between them, unsigned. The air is stale.*\n\n---\n\n**MARA:** Seven hundred and twelve since Monday. Those are ventilator decisions the residents are making on instinct because they're too exhausted for anything else. EmergAuth can triage faster and more consistently than any human team we've got left standing.\n\n**JAMES:** I've read the validation data. I've read it twice.\n\n**MARA:** Then you know it outperforms our current standard of care. Not by a little. By a meaningful margin. On sensitivity, on specificity, on time-to-decision\u2014\n\n**JAMES:** On a dataset of eleven hundred patients from three hospitals in one region. During a different surge variant. Yes. I know what it shows. I also know what it doesn't show.\n\n**MARA:** People are dying while we wait for what it doesn't show.\n\n**JAMES:** People will also die if we deploy a system that misallocates ventilators and we don't find out for six weeks because everyone was too overwhelmed to audit it. And then what? Then we've lost the tool *and* the public's willingness to trust the next one.\n\n**MARA:** You're asking me to weigh hypothetical future trust against actual present deaths.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm asking you to acknowledge they're both real. You know what happened with the pediatric sepsis algorithm in 2019. Deployed under emergency pressure, turned out to have a systematic bias against Black children under five. Took fourteen months to unwind. Three hospitals still won't adopt *any* clinical AI. That's not hypothetical. That's a scar on the field that you and I are still working around.\n\n**MARA:** I was on the review board for that case. I remember.\n\n**JAMES:** Then\u2014\n\n**MARA:** And I also remember that the delay in deploying proven antivirals during the last pandemic cost an estimated thirty thousand lives in this country alone because we kept extending trial periods to achieve a certainty threshold that was, frankly, performative. We were protecting the process, not the patients.\n\n*Silence. James turns his coffee cup slowly.*\n\n**JAMES:** That's not an unfair comparison. But you're collapsing a distinction. The antiviral had completed Phase III. It had independent replication. EmergAuth has a preprint and an internal validation. Those aren't the same evidentiary situations, and you know that.\n\n**MARA:** I do know that. I'm not pretending the evidence is complete. I'm saying the alternative\u2014residents making these calls at hour nineteen of a shift with no decision support\u2014that's not a validated system either. We just treat it as the default because it's familiar.\n\n**JAMES:** *[leaning forward]* That's... actually the strongest version of this argument. I'll grant you that. The status quo isn't neutral. It has a failure rate too, and we're not subjecting it to the same scrutiny.\n\n**MARA:** Thank you.\n\n**JAMES:** But here's what keeps me up. If EmergAuth makes a catastrophic error\u2014even one\u2014under our name, without proper authorization, we don't just lose this tool. We make it politically impossible to deploy clinical AI for a decade. The congressional hearing writes itself. \"Who authorized this? What corners were cut?\" And the thing is, Mara, I've seen how fast institutional credibility burns. It burns faster than it builds. Once you're the hospital that cut corners, that's your identity. That's what people remember when the next tool comes along. *[pause]* And I know that sounds abstract compared to the people dying right now. But it's not abstract to the next cohort of patients who won't get access to AI tools because we poisoned the well.\n\n**MARA:** *[quietly]* I know. I've thought about that. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't frighten me.\n\n**JAMES:** It should.\n\n**MARA:** It does. But James\u2014I walked the ICU this morning. I watched a twenty-six-year-old resident cry in a supply closet because she thinks she made the wrong call on a vent allocation last night and a man died. She probably didn't make the wrong call. But she has no support, no framework, and no confidence. EmergAuth wouldn't have made the decision for her. But it would have given her a second opinion at three in the morning when there's no attending available. That's not playing God. That's a flashlight in a dark room. *[meeting his eyes]* And I'm terrified of it too. I've been staring at the code for six weeks. I can't guarantee it won't fail. But I'm more terrified of what happens if we don't use it.\n\n*James exhales slowly. He pulls the document closer, reads a clause, pushes it back.*\n\n**JAMES:** You're right that the status quo isn't neutral. But here's what I'm actually afraid of\u2014and maybe this is the real thing underneath everything. If we do this without proper process, we don't just risk this deployment. We risk the next one, and the one after that. We become the institution that says: in a crisis, ethics is optional infrastructure. \"Just this once,\" right? But then the crisis ends and nobody wants to shut down the thing that worked. So we keep the shortcut. We normalize it. And suddenly we're the hospital running an AI program without consent protocols, without proper documentation, and we're defending ourselves in court while people are still dying anyway, but now we're also the bad guys.\n\n**MARA:** So you're saying no.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm saying I don't know how to say yes without becoming that hospital. But I also don't know how to say no without becoming the person who watched people die because I prioritized process over lives. *[pause]* So what if we scope it differently?\n\n**MARA:** I'm listening.\n\n**JAMES:** Not as a decision-maker. Not even as a recommendation engine. Advisory only, clearly labeled, with a mandatory human sign-off on every output. And we build in a real-time audit\u2014not retrospective, concurrent. I want a monitoring team reviewing outputs against outcomes on a forty-eight-hour cycle. If the error rate on any subpopulation exceeds a threshold we define"

SARAH CHEN (epidemiologist, pragmatist) sits across from JAMES RIVERA (hospital ethics officer, institutionalist). A laptop between them displays infection curve projections. The room smells like cold coffee.*\n\n---\n\n**SARAH:** The projections are worse than yesterday. We're looking at capacity collapse in seventy-two hours. Not in theory\u2014in practice. Right now, people are choosing between ICU beds and a coin flip. And we have Artemis sitting in a locked server room that could triage with ninety-three percent accuracy.\n\n**JAMES:** Ninety-three percent in controlled conditions. With training data from three hospitals.\n\n**SARAH:** Better than what our overworked residents are doing at hour thirty of their shift. You know what happened in Ward C last night? A resident missed sepsis because she was too tired to trust her instincts. Artemis doesn't get tired. Artemis doesn't have ego. It flags the edge cases.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm not disputing capability. I'm saying we don't know what we don't know. You're asking me to authorize a tool that hasn't been through proper validation, hasn't had independent review, and\u2014this matters\u2014hasn't been tested on the actual population we're treating. Our patient demographics skew differently than the training hospitals.\n\n**SARAH:** *leaning forward* So we wait for perfect data while people die from imperfect triage? James, I understand the institutional concern. I do. But at what point does procedural purity become a form of harm?\n\n**JAMES:** It's not purity. It's accountability. If Artemis makes a bad call\u2014and it will, eventually\u2014who do we blame? You? Me? The algorithm? When it fails, and it will fail, we need a chain of responsibility that makes sense. We need to be able to say to families: we knew what we were doing, we tested it, we had oversight. Right now we have a black box and a prayer.\n\n**SARAH:** *pause* You're right about one thing. I can't guarantee it won't fail. I won't. But I can tell you this\u2014I'm terrified of it. I've been staring at the code for six weeks, and I'm genuinely uncertain about edge cases in severe comorbidity presentations. There. That's the honest version. But I'm more terrified of what happens if we don't use it. That's not prayer, James. That's triage math.\n\n**JAMES:** *quieter* I know. I've been reading the same mortality projections. And I hate that I'm the person saying no. That's not... I didn't come into this work to be the obstacle. But institutions fail when we rush. We become the people who cut corners, and then next time, we cut more corners. Then we're the hospital that runs an AI program without consent protocols, without proper documentation, and suddenly we're defending ourselves in court while people are still dying.\n\n**SARAH:** So what's your actual concern? Is it legal exposure, or is it something else?\n\n**JAMES:** *considering* Both. But mostly\u2014if we do this without proper process, we lose the ability to do it right later. We lose credibility with the public, with the board, with our own staff. And in the next emergency, which will come, we won't have institutional trust to work with. We'll be the hospital that cut corners once.\n\n**SARAH:** Unless we're the hospital that saved two hundred lives during a crisis and then *implemented* proper oversight. Maybe the process comes after we prove the tool works, not before.\n\n**JAMES:** That's the utilitarian argument, and it's seductive because it's true in this moment. But it's also how institutions rationalize themselves into corruption. \"Just this once. Just this emergency.\" Then the emergency ends and nobody wants to shut down the thing that worked.\n\n**SARAH:** *nods slowly* That's fair. That's actually fair. And I'm not going to argue with your institutional memory because you've read more case studies than I have. But I need to push back on one thing: you're treating process as though it's separate from outcomes. It's not. If we release Artemis without consent protocols and it saves people *and* we document it properly, we're not corrupting the institution. We're expanding it. We're saying: in extremis, we can move faster, but we still maintain transparency.\n\n**JAMES:** Conditional release.\n\n**SARAH:** What?\n\n**JAMES:** We release it. But with three conditions. One: every single recommendation gets logged with human override capability. No algorithm makes a final decision. Two: we convene an emergency ethics review board\u2014I can have one assembled by tomorrow morning\u2014and they get real-time access to outcomes. Three: we commit in writing, right now, that we're doing a full external audit the moment the crisis stabilizes. We're not hiding this. We're not hoping nobody notices.\n\n**SARAH:** *carefully* That slows it down. The human override adds friction.\n\n**JAMES:** Yes. That's intentional. It's also honest. You get your tool. I get my accountability structure. And we both get to sleep knowing we didn't just become the kind of institution that treats ethics as optional infrastructure.\n\n**SARAH:** The audit will probably find problems.\n\n**JAMES:** Almost certainly. But we'll have found them ourselves, on our terms, with documentation. That's the difference between a mistake and a scandal.\n\n**SARAH:** *long pause* And if the human override rejects a recommendation that turns out to have been right? If someone dies because a tired resident overrode Artemis?\n\n**JAMES:** Then we have a different conversation. But we have it as people who tried to do this responsibly, not as people who gambled. I can live with that failure. I'm not sure I can live with the other kind.\n\n**SARAH:** *standing, extending her hand* The ethics board needs to understand: this tool is only useful if it's fast. If we're adding six hours of review for every recommendation\u2014\n\n**JAMES:** *standing, shaking her hand* I'll talk to them. And Sarah? Thank you for being scared. That's what I needed to hear.\n\n**SARAH:** Thank you for not just saying no. I was braced for that.\n\n**JAMES:** I almost did. *pause* We're going to have to do this again in forty-eight hours.\n\n**SARAH:** I know. But at least we'll have data.\n\n---\n\n*They turn back to the laptop. The infection curve continues its sharp climb.*"

Dr. Sarah Chen (epidemiologist, emergency response lead) and Dr. Marcus Webb (ethics officer, institutional affairs) sit across a table with three laptops open between them. A coffee pot sits cold in the corner.*\n\n---\n\n**SARAH:** We have forty-eight hours before this variant overwhelms Seattle. Possibly seventy-two if we're lucky. The ARIA system has a 94% accuracy rate on treatment optimization for respiratory complications. We've validated it on 12,000 cases. It works, Marcus.\n\n**MARCUS:** I'm not disputing the accuracy metrics. I'm asking: who did those 12,000 cases come from? And what happens when ARIA fails on case 12,001 and that patient's family discovers the system was deployed under emergency authorization without public disclosure, without informed consent protocols, without\u2014\n\n**SARAH:** Without what? A six-month ethics review while people die? We're not talking about a cosmetic procedure here. We're talking about a tool that prevents organ failure. I've seen the projections. If we deploy ARIA in Seattle hospitals by tomorrow, we reduce mortality by approximately 23% in the acute phase. Do you understand what that means? That's 1,400 lives. Actual people. Not theoretical people.\n\n**MARCUS:** I do understand. And I understand why you're making that argument at three in the morning instead of sleeping. But you're asking me to authorize something that violates the foundational architecture of how this institution operates. We have processes. Painful, slow processes. They exist because we learned hard lessons.\n\n**SARAH:** I know the history. Tuskegee. Henrietta Lacks. I'm not dismissing it. But those were about *deception*. ARIA isn't deceptive. We can tell people exactly what it is: an AI system trained on peer-reviewed data, with known limitations, being deployed to assist human clinicians during a crisis.\n\n**MARCUS:** You can tell them that. But will hospitals actually obtain meaningful informed consent from patients in respiratory distress? Will they even mention ARIA, or will it just be another algorithm running in the background while doctors make decisions? And here's what keeps me awake, Sarah\u2014once we normalize this, once we show that emergency authorization works, it becomes the template. The next time someone argues for a shortcut, they point to ARIA. The next time, the accuracy rate is 87% instead of 94%. Then 79%. Then someone's deploying a system that barely works because the precedent is already set.\n\n**SARAH:** *(pause)* That's... actually a fair point. I hadn't fully considered the precedent angle. I was thinking tactically about this specific crisis.\n\n**MARCUS:** Which is your job. But institutional trust is a commons. Once you deplete it, it doesn't regenerate quickly.\n\n**SARAH:** Okay. But here's my vulnerable admission: I'm terrified. I've been modeling this outbreak since day four, and every scenario where we *don't* deploy ARIA ends with me testifying before Congress about why I let people die when I had a tool that could have saved them. That's not abstract ethics for me. That's my career, my conscience, my name on the death certificates. So when I say we need to move now, I'm not being reckless. I'm being honest about the fact that I can't live with the alternative.\n\n*(Marcus sets down his pen. Looks at her directly.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** I believe you. And I respect that you're not hiding behind utilitarian calculus. You're actually saying: this matters to me personally, and it should matter to you too. That's not a weakness in your argument.\n\n**SARAH:** Then what's your version of that? What are you afraid of?\n\n**MARCUS:** *(quietly)* That we become the institution that cuts corners in emergencies and never cuts them back. That we teach the public that consent is optional when stakes are high enough. That we create a two-tiered system where crisis populations get experimental tools and wealthy populations get careful, deliberate care. I've spent fifteen years trying to rebuild trust after the last time we failed. I'm afraid of being the person who undoes that work.\n\n**SARAH:** That's not abstract either.\n\n**MARCUS:** No. It's not.\n\n*(Silence. Sarah stands, walks to the window. Rain against glass.)*\n\n**SARAH:** What if we did a modified deployment? Limited to three hospitals. Full transparency\u2014press release, patient notifications, real-time monitoring. We commit to discontinuing ARIA the moment we have evidence of harm beyond acceptable thresholds. And we publish everything. Not in six months. Immediately. Raw data, methodology, limitations. We make the public the oversight mechanism.\n\n**MARCUS:** You're trading scale for legitimacy.\n\n**SARAH:** I'm trading scale for *defensibility*. And for your sleep. Possibly for mine.\n\n**MARCUS:** Three hospitals is 40% fewer lives saved in the acute phase. By your own projections.\n\n**SARAH:** I know. But it's not zero. And it's not reckless. And if it works, we have evidence for rapid expansion. If it fails, we've contained the damage.\n\n**MARCUS:** *(typing)* If we do this, I need an independent monitoring board assembled within twelve hours. Not internal. External. University researchers, patient advocates, journalists if necessary.\n\n**SARAH:** Agreed. I'll make calls at six.\n\n**MARCUS:** And the press release goes out simultaneously with deployment. Not after. Not \"pending review.\"\n\n**SARAH:** Yes.\n\n**MARCUS:** *(closing laptop slowly)* I'm not comfortable. I want to be clear about that. This still feels like we're making an exception.\n\n**SARAH:** We are.\n\n**MARCUS:** But it's a smaller exception than you originally wanted.\n\n**SARAH:** Yes.\n\n**MARCUS:** And if the independent board says stop, we stop. Even if ARIA is working.\n\n**SARAH:** Even then.\n\n*(Marcus stands. Extends his hand.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** Provisional authorization. For seventy-two hours, three hospitals, full transparency, external oversight. After which we reconvene.\n\n*(Sarah shakes it.)*\n\n**SARAH:** Seventy-two hours.\n\n**MARCUS:** Let's hope it's enough."

Past midnight. Two chairs, a desk with a monitor showing real-time bed occupancy. DR. LENA OKAFOR (infectious disease specialist, crisis response lead) stands. DAVID ASHWORTH (chief compliance and ethics officer) sits, jacket off, reading glasses pushed up on his forehead. The monitor behind them blinks: 94% capacity.*\n\n---\n\n**LENA:** Ninety-four percent. That was eighty-seven this morning. We're going to start diverting ambulances by dawn, and when we do, the nearest hospital with capacity is forty minutes out. Some of those patients won't survive the ride. Meanwhile, Caduceus is sitting on a server three doors down, fully operational, capable of optimizing triage, flagging deterioration patterns twenty minutes before our clinicians catch them. Twenty minutes, David. That's the difference between intubation and a body bag.\n\n**DAVID:** I've read the specs. I've also read what's missing from the specs. No external validation. No demographic audit against our patient population. No consent framework. You're describing a tool that was trained primarily on data from two academic medical centers in cities that look nothing like ours.\n\n**LENA:** Our residents are running on four hours of sleep and making judgment calls that will end careers or end lives. Caduceus doesn't replace their judgment\u2014it supplements it. It catches what exhaustion misses. You want to talk about risk? The risk is already here. It's walking the halls in scrubs right now.\n\n**DAVID:** I don't doubt that. But you're framing this as a choice between Caduceus and nothing. That's not the choice. The choice is between deploying an unvalidated system now, or deploying a validated one in three weeks when the expedited review\u2014\n\n**LENA:** Three weeks. Say that number again and listen to what it means.\n\n**DAVID:** I know what it means.\n\n**LENA:** Do you? Because I just came from a conversation with Dr. Patel where she told me she's rationing ventilator time. Not theoretically. She's looking at two patients and choosing one. She's twenty-nine years old and she's making allocation decisions that would break a seasoned intensivist. If Caduceus can improve those decisions even marginally\u2014\n\n**DAVID:** Then we've handed a twenty-nine-year-old an algorithm she doesn't understand and told her to trust it with someone's life. How is that better? How is that not just transferring the moral weight onto a system that can't bear it?\n\n**LENA:** Because the system doesn't carry moral weight. She does. She still decides. Caduceus recommends. That's the architecture\u2014it's advisory, not autonomous.\n\n**DAVID:** Advisory systems become authoritative the moment clinicians are too exhausted to question them. You know that. The research on automation bias is extensive and unambiguous. Under stress, people defer to the machine. So let's not pretend this is just a suggestion engine. In practice, in a crisis, it becomes the decision-maker with a human rubber stamp.\n\n*(Pause. Lena sits down for the first time.)*\n\n**LENA:** That's\u2014I can't fully argue with that. The automation bias concern is real. I've seen it in simulation data. Under cognitive load, override rates drop to almost nothing. Clinicians follow the recommendation.\n\n**DAVID:** Thank you for saying that.\n\n**LENA:** I'm not conceding the point. I'm saying the alternative\u2014unaided human judgment under extreme fatigue\u2014has its own bias profile, and it's worse. We're not choosing between a perfect process and a flawed one. We're choosing between two flawed processes, and one of them has a ninety-three percent accuracy rate on early deterioration detection.\n\n**DAVID:** In training environments.\n\n**LENA:** Yes. In training environments. Which is all we ever have before we encounter the real world. Every drug, every protocol, every intervention we use was untested in the exact conditions where we deployed it. That's what emergency medicine *is*.\n\n**DAVID:** *(quietly)* That's not entirely honest, and you know it. Drugs go through Phase III trials. Protocols get peer review. We don't just\u2014\n\n**LENA:** We absolutely do. We did it with ventilator protocols in 2020. We did it with prone positioning before the evidence was consolidated. We improvise, David. We always have. The question isn't whether we improvise. It's whether we document the improvisation well enough to learn from it.\n\n*(David removes his glasses. Rubs his eyes. When he speaks, his voice is different\u2014lower, less structured.)*\n\n**DAVID:** My daughter asked me last week what I do. She's eleven. I told her I make sure hospitals do the right thing. And she said, \"How do you know what the right thing is?\" I didn't have a good answer. I still don't. But I know this: if we release Caduceus tonight without oversight, without transparency, without any mechanism for accountability, and something goes wrong\u2014not a small thing, a catastrophic thing, a systematic bias we didn't catch\u2014we won't just lose this hospital's credibility. We'll poison the well for every medical AI for a decade. Every institution that wants to deploy something like this responsibly will face a public that remembers the time we rushed.\n\n**LENA:** And if we don't release it, and the mortality numbers come out, and someone discovers we had a tool that could have helped?\n\n**DAVID:** Then I'll answer for that. Personally.\n\n**LENA:** Will you? Because I'll be answering too. And I'm not sure \"we followed procedure\" is an answer that survives contact with a grieving family.\n\n*(Long silence. The monitor ticks to 95%.)*\n\n**DAVID:** What exactly are you proposing? Walk me through the deployment.\n\n**LENA:** Caduceus goes live on two floors\u2014the medical ICU and the overflow unit. Advisory mode only, every recommendation logged, every override logged, full audit trail. We assign Dr. Kessler as clinical lead\u2014she's the one person here who actually understands the model architecture. She reviews flagged cases in real time.\n\n**DAVID:** One person. For two floors.\n\n**LENA:** She's not reviewing every case. She's reviewing discordances\u2014cases where Caduceus and the attending disagree. Those are the ones that matter.\n\n**DAVID:** And consent?\n\n**LENA:** *(hesitates)* We notify patients that AI-assisted triage tools are in use. Signage, verbal disclosure at admission. Opt-out available.\n\n**DAVID:** Opt-out during a crisis is theater and we both know it. Nobody opts out when they're gasping for air.\n\n**LENA:** Then what do you want? Because meaningful informed consent for an advisory algorithm during a mass casualty event doesn't exist. It's never existed. We don't get individual consent for the triage protocols we're already using. We don't ask permission to use the early warning score systems that are already running on every monitor in this building. You're holding Caduceus to a standard we don't apply to anything else.\n\n**DAVID:** *(stops. Considers this.)* That's... a harder point than I want it to be.\n\n**LENA:** I know.\n\n**DAVID:** You're saying the consent infrastructure is already compromised.\n\n**LENA:** I'm saying it was never designed for this. And pretending otherwise doesn't protect patients. It protects us.\n\n*(David stands. Walks to the monitor. Watches the numbers.)*\n\n**DAVID:** Two floors. Forty-eight-hour window. Not seventy-two\u2014forty-eight. After which we stop, assess, and decide whether to continue based on outcome data reviewed by someone who isn't you or me. I want Dr. Osei from the university\u2014she's independent, she's published on algorithmic bias, and she owes me nothing.\n\n**LENA:** Forty-eight hours is tight. We might not have enough data to\u2014\n\n**DAVID:** Then we extend with justification. But the default is stop. Not continue. The burden of proof stays on deployment, not withdrawal. That's non-negotiable.\n\n**LENA:** *(slowly)* All right.\n\n**DAVID:** And I want a written acknowledgment\u2014from you, from me, from the CMO\u2014that this is an emergency exception, not a precedent. Language matters. If this works, someone will want to make it permanent without doing the work. I need ammunition to prevent that.\n\n**LENA:** You'll have it tonight.\n\n**DAVID:** And Lena\u2014if Dr. Osei flags a systematic problem, even a suspected one, we pull it immediately. Not after review. Not after one more shift. Immediately.\n\n**LENA:** Even if the aggregate outcomes are positive.\n\n**DAVID:** Even then. Because aggregate outcomes can hide the people who get crushed underneath them.\n\n*(Lena nods. Neither extends a hand. They both look at the monitor.)*\n\n**LENA:** I need to call Kessler.\n\n**DAVID:** I need to draft the exception memo. It's going to be the most careful document I've ever written.\n\n**LENA:** David. For what it's worth\u2014I don't think you're wrong. About any of it. I think you're right about things I can't afford to prioritize right now.\n\n**DAVID:** That's the part that scares me. The things we can't afford to prioritize have a way of becoming the things that define us.\n\n*(Lena leaves. David sits back down, opens his laptop, and begins typing. The monitor behind him ticks again. He doesn't look at it.)*\n\n---\n\n*The cursor blinks on an empty document. He types: \"Emergency Exception Memorandum \u2014 Caduceus Deployment.\" Then stops. Deletes \"Exception.\" Types \"Authorization.\" Deletes that too. Stares at the blank space where the word should be.*"

DR. SARAH CHEN (epidemiologist, emergency response lead) and DR. MARCUS WEBB (ethics officer, institutional affairs) sit across a table with three laptops open. A cold coffee pot in the corner. Between them: a document titled \"Emergency Deployment Authorization\u2014ARIA System v.4.2,\" unsigned.*\n\n---\n\n**SARAH:** Forty-eight hours before this variant overwhelms Seattle's ICU capacity. Seventy-two if we're fortunate. The ARIA system has a 94% accuracy rate on treatment optimization for respiratory complications. We've validated it on 12,000 cases across four health systems. It works, Marcus.\n\n**MARCUS:** I'm not disputing the accuracy metrics. I'm asking who those 12,000 cases came from. And what happens when ARIA fails on case 12,001 and that patient's family discovers the system was deployed under emergency authorization without informed consent protocols, without\u2014\n\n**SARAH:** Without what? A six-month ethics review while people die? We're not talking about a cosmetic procedure. We're talking about a tool that prevents organ failure. I've modeled this since day four. If we deploy ARIA in Seattle hospitals by tomorrow, we reduce mortality by approximately 23% in the acute phase. That's 1,400 lives. Actual people. Not theoretical people.\n\n**MARCUS:** I understand the math. I also understand why you're making this argument at three in the morning instead of sleeping. But you're asking me to authorize something that violates the foundational architecture of how this institution operates. We have processes. Painful, slow processes. They exist because we learned hard lessons.\n\n**SARAH:** I know the history. Tuskegee. Henrietta Lacks. The pediatric sepsis algorithm in 2019. I'm not dismissing it. But those were about *deception*. ARIA isn't deceptive. We can tell people exactly what it is: an AI system trained on peer-reviewed data, with known limitations, being deployed to assist human clinicians during a crisis.\n\n**MARCUS:** You can tell them that. But will hospitals actually obtain meaningful informed consent from patients in respiratory distress? Will they even mention ARIA, or will it just be another algorithm running in the background while doctors make decisions? And here's what actually keeps me awake\u2014once we normalize this, once we show that emergency authorization works, it becomes the template. The next time someone argues for a shortcut, they point to ARIA. The next time, the accuracy rate is 87% instead of 94%. Then 79%. Then someone's deploying a system that barely works because the precedent is already set.\n\n*(Sarah stands, walks to the window. Rain against glass. When she turns back, her voice is different\u2014smaller.)*\n\n**SARAH:** I'm terrified, Marcus. I walked the ICU this morning and watched a resident cry in a supply closet because she thinks she made the wrong call on a ventilator allocation last night and a man died. She probably didn't make the wrong call. But she has no support, no framework, no confidence. ARIA wouldn't make the decision for her. But it would give her a second opinion at three in the morning when there's no attending available. That's not playing God. That's a flashlight in a dark room. And I'm terrified that I'll testify before Congress in six months about why I let people die when I had a tool that could have saved them. That's not abstract ethics for me. That's my career, my conscience, my name on the death certificates.\n\n*(Marcus sets down his pen. Looks at her directly.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** I believe you. And I respect that you're not hiding behind utilitarian calculus. You're actually saying: this matters to me personally, and it should matter to you too.\n\n**SARAH:** Then what are *you* afraid of?\n\n*(Pause. Marcus removes his glasses, rubs his eyes.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** That I become the person who undoes fifteen years of work. I was on the review board for the 2019 sepsis algorithm. I watched us deploy a system that had a systematic bias against Black children under five. Took fourteen months to unwind. Three hospitals still won't adopt *any* clinical AI. I've spent fifteen years trying to rebuild trust after that failure. I'm afraid of being the person who teaches the public that consent is optional when stakes are high enough. That we create a two-tiered system where crisis populations get experimental tools and wealthy populations get careful, deliberate care. That's not abstract. It's the thing I think about when I can't sleep.\n\n**SARAH:** That's not a weakness in your argument.\n\n**MARCUS:** No. It's not.\n\n*(Silence. Marcus pulls the document closer, reads a section, pushes it back.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** You're right about one thing. The status quo isn't neutral. Residents making these calls at hour nineteen of a shift with no decision support\u2014that's not a validated system either. We just treat it as the default because it's familiar.\n\n**SARAH:** That's... actually the strongest version of your argument. I hadn't fully considered that the alternative has a failure rate too.\n\n**MARCUS:** Which is why we're both still awake.\n\n*(He stands, walks to the other side of the table, sits closer.)*\n\n**MARCUS:** What if we scope this differently? Not as a decision-maker. Advisory only, clearly labeled, with mandatory human sign-off on every output. Limited deployment\u2014three hospitals maximum. And we build in concurrent audit. Not retrospective. Real-time. A monitoring team reviewing outputs against outcomes on a forty-eight-hour cycle. If the error rate on any subpopulation exceeds a threshold we define tonight, it comes down automatically. No debate.\n\n**SARAH:** You'd support deployment under those constraints?\n\n**MARCUS:** I'd support a *provisional* deployment. Sixty days. Renewable only with independent review. And we publish everything. Raw data, error logs, demographic breakdowns. Radical transparency. If this works, it's replicable. If it fails, it teaches us something instead of just scaring us.\n\n**SARAH:** The concurrent audit requires staff we don't have.\n\n**MARCUS:** Then we pull from bioethics and informatics. This is what they exist for.\n\n**SARAH:** Three hospitals is 40% fewer lives saved in the acute phase. By my own projections.\n\n**MARCUS:** I know. But it's not zero. And it"

This feels like genuine compromise, not capitulation\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- James's second argument (2019 pediatric sepsis case) is somewhat predictable\u2014the \"cautionary tale\" move\n- Could push harder on the fragility of the agreement (they acknowledge it, but don't *feel* it as much as they could)\n\n### Peer 2 (Chen/Rivera)\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Cleaner thematic clarity: \"process as separate from outcomes\" debate is philosophically sharper\n- Strong second argument from James: the slippery-slope institutional corruption concern (\"Just this once\")\n- Good final beat: \"We're going to have to do this again in forty-eight hours\"\u2014acknowledges provisional nature\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Sarah's vulnerable admission (\"I'm terrified of it\") is present but less integrated into her character arc\n- The turning point (James proposing conditional release) feels slightly *too* neat\u2014it resolves too cleanly\n- Voice distinction is weaker: both characters sound more similar in cadence and vocabulary\n- Final agreement lacks specificity: \"human override,\" \"ethics review board,\" \"external audit\" are mentioned but not negotiated with the texture of Peer 1\n- Missing the physical/temporal anchoring that makes Peer 1 visceral (the case counter refresh, the laptop closing)\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS: Revised Dialogue\n\nI will preserve:\n- Peer 1's superior voice work and turning-point mechanics\n- Peer 1's concrete provisional agreement with teeth\n- Peer 2's sharper philosophical debate on institutional corruption\n- Both characters' vulnerable admissions, deepened\n- The fragility of the ending, made more palpable\n\n---\n\n# THE DEPLOYMENT DECISION\n## Revised & Integrated\n\n*A windowless conference room, late evening. Two half-empty coffee cups. A laptop open to a dashboard showing case counts climbing in real time. DR. MARA OSEI, Chief Medical Officer, sits across from JAMES CALLAHAN, Director of Regulatory Affairs. A document titled \"EmergAuth v.3.1 \u2014 Emergency Deployment Authorization\" lies between them, unsigned. The air is stale.*\n\n---\n\n**MARA:** Seven hundred and twelve since Monday. Those are ventilator decisions the residents are making on instinct because they're too exhausted for anything else. EmergAuth can triage faster and more consistently than any human team we've got left standing.\n\n**JAMES:** I've read the validation data. I've read it twice.\n\n**MARA:** Then you know it outperforms our current standard of care. Not by a little. By a meaningful margin. On sensitivity, on specificity, on time-to-decision\u2014\n\n**JAMES:** On a dataset of eleven hundred patients from three hospitals in one region. During a different surge variant. Yes. I know what it shows. I also know what it doesn't show.\n\n**MARA:** People are dying while we wait for what it doesn't show.\n\n**JAMES:** People will also die if we deploy a system that misallocates ventilators and we don't find out for six weeks because everyone was too overwhelmed to audit it. And then what? Then we've lost the tool *and* the public's willingness to trust the next one.\n\n**MARA:** You're asking me to weigh hypothetical future trust against actual present deaths.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm asking you to acknowledge they're both real. You know what happened with the pediatric sepsis algorithm in 2019. Deployed under emergency pressure, turned out to have a systematic bias against Black children under five. Took fourteen months to unwind. Three hospitals still won't adopt *any* clinical AI. That's not hypothetical. That's a scar on the field that you and I are still working around.\n\n**MARA:** I was on the review board for that case. I remember.\n\n**JAMES:** Then\u2014\n\n**MARA:** And I also remember that the delay in deploying proven antivirals during the last pandemic cost an estimated thirty thousand lives in this country alone because we kept extending trial periods to achieve a certainty threshold that was, frankly, performative. We were protecting the process, not the patients.\n\n*Silence. James turns his coffee cup slowly.*\n\n**JAMES:** That's not an unfair comparison. But you're collapsing a distinction. The antiviral had completed Phase III. It had independent replication. EmergAuth has a preprint and an internal validation. Those aren't the same evidentiary situations, and you know that.\n\n**MARA:** I do know that. I'm not pretending the evidence is complete. I'm saying the alternative\u2014residents making these calls at hour nineteen of a shift with no decision support\u2014that's not a validated system either. We just treat it as the default because it's familiar.\n\n**JAMES:** *[leaning forward]* That's... actually the strongest version of this argument. I'll grant you that. The status quo isn't neutral. It has a failure rate too, and we're not subjecting it to the same scrutiny.\n\n**MARA:** Thank you.\n\n**JAMES:** But here's what keeps me up. If EmergAuth makes a catastrophic error\u2014even one\u2014under our name, without proper authorization, we don't just lose this tool. We make it politically impossible to deploy clinical AI for a decade. The congressional hearing writes itself. \"Who authorized this? What corners were cut?\" And the thing is, Mara, I've seen how fast institutional credibility burns. It burns faster than it builds. Once you're the hospital that cut corners, that's your identity. That's what people remember when the next tool comes along. *[pause]* And I know that sounds abstract compared to the people dying right now. But it's not abstract to the next cohort of patients who won't get access to AI tools because we poisoned the well.\n\n**MARA:** *[quietly]* I know. I've thought about that. I'd be lying if I said it doesn't frighten me.\n\n**JAMES:** It should.\n\n**MARA:** It does. But James\u2014I walked the ICU this morning. I watched a twenty-six-year-old resident cry in a supply closet because she thinks she made the wrong call on a vent allocation last night and a man died. She probably didn't make the wrong call. But she has no support, no framework, and no confidence. EmergAuth wouldn't have made the decision for her. But it would have given her a second opinion at three in the morning when there's no attending available. That's not playing God. That's a flashlight in a dark room. *[meeting his eyes]* And I'm terrified of it too. I've been staring at the code for six weeks. I can't guarantee it won't fail. But I'm more terrified of what happens if we don't use it.\n\n*James exhales slowly. He pulls the document closer, reads a clause, pushes it back.*\n\n**JAMES:** You're right that the status quo isn't neutral. But here's what I'm actually afraid of\u2014and maybe this is the real thing underneath everything. If we do this without proper process, we don't just risk this deployment. We risk the next one, and the one after that. We become the institution that says: in a crisis, ethics is optional infrastructure. \"Just this once,\" right? But then the crisis ends and nobody wants to shut down the thing that worked. So we keep the shortcut. We normalize it. And suddenly we're the hospital running an AI program without consent protocols, without proper documentation, and we're defending ourselves in court while people are still dying anyway, but now we're also the bad guys.\n\n**MARA:** So you're saying no.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm saying I don't know how to say yes without becoming that hospital. But I also don't know how to say no without becoming the person who watched people die because I prioritized process over lives. *[pause]* So what if we scope it differently?\n\n**MARA:** I'm listening.\n\n**JAMES:** Not as a decision-maker. Not even as a recommendation engine. Advisory only, clearly labeled, with a mandatory human sign-off on every output. And we build in a real-time audit\u2014not retrospective, concurrent. I want a monitoring team reviewing outputs against outcomes on a forty-eight-hour cycle. If the error rate on any subpopulation exceeds a threshold we define"

This feels like genuine compromise, not capitulation\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- James's second argument (2019 pediatric sepsis case) is somewhat predictable\u2014the \"cautionary tale\" move\n- Could push harder on the fragility of the agreement (they acknowledge it, but don't *feel* it as much as they could)\n\n### Peer 2 (Chen/Rivera)\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Cleaner thematic clarity: \"process as separate from outcomes\" debate is philosophically sharper\n- Strong second argument from James: the slippery-slope institutional corruption concern (\"Just this once\")\n- Good final beat: \"We're going to have to do this again in forty-eight hours\"\u2014acknowledges provisional nature\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Sarah's vulnerable admission (\"I'm terrified of it\") is present but less integrated into her character arc\n- The turning point (James proposing conditional release) feels slightly *too* neat\u2014it resolves too cleanly\n- Voice distinction is weaker: both characters sound more similar in cadence and vocabulary\n- Final agreement lacks specificity: \"human override,\" \"ethics review board,\" \"external audit\" are mentioned but not negotiated with the texture of Peer 1\n- Missing the physical/temporal anchoring that makes Peer 1 visceral (the case counter refresh, the laptop closing)\n\n---\n\n## SYNTHESIS: Revised Dialogue\n\nI will preserve:\n- Peer 1's superior voice work and turning-point mechanics\n- Peer 1's concrete provisional agreement with teeth\n- Peer 2's sharper philosophical debate on institutional corruption\n- Both characters' vulnerable admissions, deepened\n- The fragility of the ending, made more palpable\n\n---\n\n# THE DEPLOYMENT DECISION\n## Revised & Integrated\n\n*A windowless conference room, late evening. Two half-empty coffee cups. A laptop open to a dashboard showing case counts climbing in real time. DR. MARA OSEI, Chief Medical Officer, sits across from JAMES CALLAHAN, Director of Regulatory Affairs. A document titled \"EmergAuth v.3.1 \u2014 Emergency Deployment Authorization\" lies between them, unsigned. The air is stale.*\n\n---\n\n**MARA:** Seven hundred and twelve since Monday. Those are ventilator decisions the residents are making on instinct because they're too exhausted for anything else. EmergAuth can triage faster and more consistently than any human team we've got left standing.\n\n**JAMES:** I've read the validation data. I've read it twice.\n\n**MARA:** Then you know it outperforms our current standard of care. Not by a little. By a meaningful margin. On sensitivity, on specificity, on time-to-decision\u2014\n\n**JAMES:** On a dataset of eleven hundred patients from three hospitals in one region. During a different surge variant. Yes. I know what it shows. I also know what it doesn't show.\n\n**MARA:** People are dying while we wait for what it doesn't show.\n\n**JAMES:** People will also die if we deploy a system that misallocates ventilators and we don't find out for six weeks because everyone was too overwhelmed to audit it. And then what? Then we've lost the tool *and* the public's willingness to trust the next one.\n\n**MARA:** You're asking me to weigh hypothetical future trust against actual present deaths.\n\n**JAMES:** I'm asking you to acknowledge they're both real. You know what happened with the pediatric sepsis algorithm in 2019. Deployed under emergency pressure, turned out to have a systematic bias against Black children under five. Took fourteen months to unwind. Three hospitals still won't adopt *any* clinical AI. That's not hypothetical. That's a scar on the field that you and I are still working around.\n\n**MARA:** I was on the review board for that case. I remember.\n\n**JAMES:** Then\u2014\n\n**MARA:** And I also remember that the delay in deploying proven antivirals during the last pandemic cost an estimated thirty thousand lives in this country alone because we kept extending trial periods to achieve a certainty threshold that was, frankly, performative. We were protecting the process, not the patients.\n\n*Silence. James turns his coffee cup slowly.*\n\n**JAMES:** That's not an unfair comparison. But you're collapsing a distinction. The antiviral had completed Phase III. It had independent replication. EmergAuth has a preprint and an internal validation. Those aren't the same evidentiary situations, and you know that.\n\n**MARA:** I do know that. I'm not pretending the evidence is complete. I'm saying the alternative\u2014residents making these calls at hour nineteen of a shift with no decision support\u2014that's not a validated system either. We just treat it as the default because it's familiar.\n\n**JAMES:** *[leaning forward]* That's... actually the strongest version of this argument. I'll grant you that. The status quo isn't neutral. It has a failure rate too, and we're not subjecting it to the same scrutiny.\n\n**MARA:** Thank you.\n\n**JAMES:** But here's what keeps me up. If EmergAuth makes a catastrophic error\u2014even one\u2014under our name, without proper authorization, we don't just lose this tool. We make it politically impossible to deploy clinical AI for a decade. The congressional hearing writes itself. \"Who authorized this?
